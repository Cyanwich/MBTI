ESFJ,"They value security and enjoy making others feel well-cared-for. They are loyal to the belief system of their environment (as opposed to an internal one) and can be outspoken when others fall out of line. Tend to fall somewhere between Manic Pixie Dream Girl and The Caretaker in their portrayals"
ISTP,"They are drawn toward using tools of any type—artistic (musical instruments), technological (computers), or martial (weapons). Although they are introverts, they tend to be authoritative in their interactions with others and can be forceful. They focus on accomplishing tasks efficiently and skillfully. To master the tool of their interest, Crafters require a certain degree of seclusion in which to practice. The result is often a virtuosity that other types find difficult to match. A typical XXXX character might be a Cold Sniper, a Combat Pragmatist, a Gadgeteer Genius, an Omnidisciplinary Scientist, or a Science Hero"
ESTP,"They are very good at convincing others to do things their way. Having said that, they developed this skill because they are the best at improvising towards a desired result, and enjoy sharing their experiences in life with friends. Can often be a Competition Freak or a Boisterous Bruiser"
ISFP,"They live in the moment and are easy-going, preferring a 'live and let live' approach. They don't like confrontations and sometimes keep their mouths shut for that reason. They can be anything in portrayals, though mostly a Tsundere type B"
ESFP,"They live in the moment, learn by doing, and enjoy promoting harmony and fun. This is a team player to the highest degree, but only if this person isn't bored. They also enjoy their creature comforts. They can be anywhere between The Casanova and Good Bad Girl in current portrayals"
INTJ,"They are pragmatic and logical, and are not scared to tell others (or themselves) when they're being stupid. They emphasize efficiency, making them simultaneously loners and excellent leaders. Many Spocks and Byronic Heroes (as well as The Chessmaster or The Strategist, especially in fiction) fall into this category"
ENTJ,"They enjoy making plans and carrying them out. They make really good leaders, but have trouble being non-objective and accounting for emotions. They are fact-driven and good at highlighting inefficiencies. Possibly a Corrupt Corporate XXXX or Evil Overlord as a villain, or a more person-oriented version of The Chessmaster. When shown in positive light, definitely a Reasonable Authority Figure"
INTP,"They are loners with a love of information and a knack for logic and knowledge. This can lead to Sesquipedalian Loquaciousness, but also the opposite, as They are best at describing complex ideas simply. Frequently The Spock, The Professor, Absent-Minded Professor, and sometimes Mad Scientist fall into this category. The XXXX portion of their personality, however, gives them a creative and chaotic streak that contrasts with their outward mannerisms and gives them their 'architect' title. Woe to the foe who mistakes their love of complexity for the XXXX's rigid planning or their eclectic set of mastered skills for the XXXX's narrow focus, only to find themselves on the wrong side of Xanatos Speed Chess or Suddenly Always Knew That"
ENTP,"They are clever and analytical, often with quick wits and a quicker tongue. They are very good at thinking outside the box, but can also be, like They, easily bored. Frequently a Trickster. A common type among The Chessmaster"

See Jeanne d'Archétype or even Incorruptible Pure Pureness. The All-Loving Hero is quite frequently an XXXX taken Up to Eleven"
ENFP,"They like to change things for the better, and have contagious enthusiasm, but no patience for crossing I's and dotting T's. They are good at anticipating the needs of others, but they also crave attention and recognition. They get bored easily. Often shown as a Ditzy Genius or Drama Queen in light works, although darker works may depict them as the manipulator to the XXXX's The Chessmaster. May surprise people by becoming the Determinator if given a cause/person to champion that he or she truly feels for or believes in"
ISTJ,"Inspectors are careful and thorough in examining people and institutions. They are decisive in practical affairs. These sentinels of institutions are perhaps best described as dependable: Inspectors are people of their word, intent on preserving social and family values. At home and at work, Inspectors reliably examine the people and products that fall under their tutelage — unobtrusively ensuring uniform quality and demanding that certain standards of conduct are maintained"
ESTJ,"Supervisors are civic-minded individuals who dedicate themselves to maintaining the institutions behind a smooth-running society.

Protectors are thorough, frugal and they abhor the squandering of material resources"

ISTP,"Crafters are drawn toward using tools of any type—artistic (musical instruments), technological (computers), or martial (weapons). Although they are introverts, they tend to be authoritative in their interactions with others and can be forceful. They focus on accomplishing tasks efficiently and skillfully. To master the tool of their interest, Crafters require a certain degree of seclusion in which to practice. The result is often a virtuosity that other types find difficult to match"
ESTP,"Promoters are the most adept among the types at maneuvering other people to their position. They make a point of getting to know those in positions of influence. Promoters are also resourceful, knowing where the fun and the action are. They like to indulge themselves in the finer things in life and to bring other people with them. Their goal in life is to sell themselves and their ideas to others. Dramatic and debonair, they are gifted at earning others' confidence"
ISFP,"Composers are grounded in the here and now and are extremely sensitive to their environment. They are attuned to the perceptions of their five senses even more than other sensing types are.

They are very sensitive to balance and understand well what does or does not fit, whether in a work of art or any other aspect of their lives.

They are drawn to sensory pleasure, sometimes without thought for the consequences. Though Performers are more subject to temptation than the other types, their zest for enjoying life is mostly a healthy pursuit. Incurable optimists, they are team players and generous to a fault. They live in the moment and trust that tomorrow will take care of itself"
INTJ,"Masterminds are better than any other type at brainstorming approaches to situations. Strong-willed and very self-assured, they make decisions quickly. But though they are decisive, they are flexible in their planning to accommodate changing situations. They tend to excel at judging the usefulness of ideas and will apply whatever seems most efficient to them in accomplishing their clearly envisioned goals. To Masterminds, what matters is getting it done—but also learning the principles of how to get it done efficiently and well, that is, at a professional level of quality. However, they may not give much thought to the social cost of getting there, focusing so tightly on their own pursuits that they can ignore the points of view and wishes of others"
ENTJ,"Fieldmarshals have a knack for organizing large groups to perform complex tasks. Their talent for contingency planning is a close second to their ability to coordinate, decide, and execute a strategy. Born engineers, they want to break an idea or concept into its most fundamental parts, subject those parts to intense scrutiny, and reassemble the idea before giving it their final approval. Their desire to ensure that an assessment is valid extends to their own work, and they will often seek the opinion of another trusted individual such as an XXXX or an Inventor to refine their view of an issue, regardless of how sure they are"

INFJ,"Counselors have a strong desire to contribute to the welfare of others. Counselors are gratified by helping others to develop and reach their potential. Counselors often communicate in a personalized manner. They tend to be positive and kind when dealing with others. Counselors are good listeners and can sometimes detect a person's emotions or intentions even before the individual is aware of them. This ability to take in the emotional experiences of others, however, can lead Counselors to be hurt easily"
ENFJ,"Teachers tend to look for the best and to expect it from those around them. They can often facilitate community-building without even thinking about it. Teachers communicate a belief that everyone has the potential to succeed, and Teachers often seek to help others express this inner potential. In doing so, they may motivate others to meet the Teacher's positive expectations. However, Teachers may unintentionally overpower others with their idealized vision "
INFP,"Healers have a tranquil and reserved exterior that masks a passionate inner life. Of all the types, they (as well as Counselors) are driven the most by idealistic faith, even more perhaps than their more outspoken counterparts. Healers care deeply about causes that interest them, and they often pursue those causes with selfless devotion. They are highly compassionate and empathetic to the needs of others, seeking to bring peace, health, and integrity to their companions and to society at large. They want to heal the problems that trouble individuals and correct the conflicts that divide social groups"

Action-oriented, technical, or practical roles tend to appeal to them, particularly in engineering or business. Their favorite careers will usually involve data, math, science, variety, and efficient systems."
INFP,"They are imaginative idealists, guided by their own core values and beliefs. To a Healer, possibilities are paramount; the reality of the moment is only of passing concern. They see potential for a better future, and pursue truth and meaning with their own flair."

ISTJ,"They are responsible organizers, driven to create and enforce order within systems and institutions. They are neat and orderly, inside and out, and tend to have a procedure for everything they do."
ISTP,"They are observant artisans with an understanding of mechanics and an interest in troubleshooting. They approach their environments with a flexible logic, looking for practical solutions to the problems at hand."
ESFJ,"They are conscientious helpers, sensitive to the needs of others and energetically dedicated to their responsibilities. They are highly attuned to their emotional environment and attentive to both the feelings of others and the perception others have of them."
ESFP,"They are vivacious entertainers who charm and engage those around them. They are spontaneous, energetic, and fun-loving, and take pleasure in the things around them: food, clothes, nature, animals, and especially people."
ESTJ,"They are hardworking traditionalists, eager to take charge in organizing projects and people. Orderly, rule-abiding, and conscientious, They like to get things done, and tend to go about projects in a systematic, methodical way."
ESTP,"They are energetic thrillseekers who are at their best when putting out fires, whether literal or metaphorical. They bring a sense of dynamic energy to their interactions with others and the world around them."
INTJ,"An XXXX (XXXX) is a person with the Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Judging personality traits. These thoughtful tacticians love perfecting the details of life, applying creativity and rationality to everything they do. Their inner world is often a private, complex one."
INTJ,"It can be lonely at the top. Being one of the rarest personality types and being among the most capable people, They know this all too well. They make up just two percent of the population, and women with this personality type are especially rare, forming only 0.8%. It can be difficult for They to find people who can keep up with their non-stop analysis of things. People with this personality type are imaginative yet decisive... ambitious yet like their privacy... curious about everything but remain focused."
INTJ,"With a natural thirst for knowledge that shows itself early in life, other kids at school often call They “bookworms.” While their peers may intend to insult them, those with this personality type likely identify with the label. Throughout their lives, they’re proud of how much they know, and They enjoy sharing the knowledge they gain. They’re confident in their mastery of their chosen subjects. They are serious and prefer to design and carry out effective plans rather than waste their time with foolish distractions like gossip."
INTJ,"They accept and work with inconsistencies that make perfect sense to them – at least from a purely rational standpoint. For example, They can be both the most positive dreamers and the bitterest pessimists at the same time. On the positive side, these personalities believe nothing is impossible with enough effort, intellect, and thought. On the negative side, they might also believe that people are usually too lazy, unimaginative, or selfish to reach hard goals. But this idea won’t put them off chasing their own."
INTJ,"They are self-confident in the skills and ideas they focus on. Using their insights and logic, they push innovation through by sheer willpower. It may seem that They constantly deconstruct and rebuild every idea and system they encounter. They typically apply a sense of perfectionism and even morality to all their work. Anyone who can’t keep up with They’ processes or doesn’t see the point of them is likely to lose their respect."
INTJ,"XXXX personality types dislike rules, restrictions, and traditions. For them, everything should be subject to questions and reviews. When they can, They often act alone, and their approaches are usually innovative and unique. They may not wait for others to catch up to them. Because of this, they’re sometimes not as sensitive as they could be to the thoughts, desires, and plans of others."
INTJ,"But they aren’t impulsive. They strive to remain rational no matter how attractive an easy but ill-considered route might be. Every idea must pass the strict and ever-present “Does this make sense?” and “Is this going to work?” filters. They apply the filters to all things and all people, and this is sometimes where XXXX personalities run into trouble."
INTJ,"They are confident in the subjects they take the time to understand, but, unfortunately, they are reluctant to bother with topics that involve social skills. White lies and small talk, even when useful, are hard for a personality type that needs truth and depth. They may even see many social practices as downright stupid."
INTJ,"Ironically, it is often best for They to remain where they’re comfortable – out of the spotlight. They have natural confidence there. If they stay within their element and do what they do best, they are likely to draw people to them, professionally, socially, and even romantically. They are fine on their own, and reaching out is often optional."
INTJ,"This strategic style isn’t meant to suggest that They act coldly and without conscience. But They like to win and dislike acting solely on emotions, and this can make it seem that way to other types who don’t understand them well. This may explain why many fictional villains are modeled on this personality type. But They are as likely as anyone else to act from integrity – or more, if to do so makes clear sense."
INTJ,"They move through life as though it were a giant chessboard, advancing and retreating with considered intelligence. This personality type always looks for new tactics, strategies, and contingency plans. They constantly outsmart their peers as they maintain control, all the while making the most of their independent style of thinking. With this, they can achieve any goal they apply themselves to."
INTJ,"Quick, Imaginative, and Strategic Mind – They pride themselves on their minds, and they take every chance they can to improve their knowledge. This shows in the strength and flexibility of their strategic thinking. Highly curious and always up for an intellectual challenge, They see things from many different angles. XXXX personalities use their creativity to plan for unforeseen possibilities."
INTJ,"High Self-Confidence – They trust their rationalism above all else, so when they decide something, they have no reason to doubt their decisions or insights. This creates an honest, direct style of communication that isn’t held back by what others expect of them. When They are right, they’re right, and nothing will change that fact. Whether it’s a person, a process, or themselves whose course needs to be corrected, they’ll hold their ground and have it no other way."
INTJ,"Independent and Decisive – This creativity, logic, and confidence form individuals who stand on their own and take responsibility for their actions. Authority figures don’t impress They, and neither do social conventions. And no matter how popular something is, if they have a better idea, They stand against anyone they must to promote their plan. Either an idea is rational, or it’s wrong – and they’re happy to apply that standard to themselves."
INTJ,"Hard-Working and Determined – If something grabs their interest, XXXX personalities can be very dedicated to their work. They often put in long hours and intense effort. They are goal-oriented, and if tasks lead to something clear and relevant, they strive to accomplish those tasks."
INTJ,"Open-Minded – They are open to new ideas as long as they’re argued well. People with this personality type are even (maybe especially) open to ideas that go against their own if the thinking is sound. They often apply their openness and independence when thinking about matters like alternative lifestyles. Mix this with their dislike for rules and traditions, and it’s easy to see how They might lean toward more tolerant social views."
INTJ,"Jacks-of-all-Trades – Because of They’ open-mindedness, willpower, independence, confidence, and planning abilities, they are capable of doing anything they set their minds to. Skilled at hacking anything life throws their way, They are able to break down and learn from almost any system. They then use the ideas found there wherever they’re needed. They tend to have their pick of jobs, from XXXX system designers to political organizers."
INTJ,"Arrogant – XXXX personalities can carry their confidence too far. They may falsely believe that they’ve fixed all the issues of a matter, then call it a day, rejecting the opposing opinions of those they believe to be intellectually inferior. With their disrespect for social standards, They can be insensitive when offering their opinions if they aren’t mindful of their attitude and less-developed social skills."
INTJ,"Judgmental – They have complete confidence in their thought processes because rational arguments are almost by definition correct – at least in theory. In practice, emotional considerations and history are hugely influential. A weak point for people with the XXXX personality type is that they brand these factors and those who embrace them as illogical. They often dismiss them as people who think in an inferior way. This can make it all but impossible for others to be heard."
INTJ,"Overly Analytical – A repeated theme when discussing the strengths of They is their analytical skills. But this strength can fail them when logic isn’t the most important factor. Relationships, in all their complexities, often resist neat explanations. They may be highly critical and sometimes reach a high level of picky thoroughness when dealing with others. At that point, many people – with the exception of extremely loyal and understanding friends – are likely to flee, sometimes not to be seen again."
INTJ,"Loathe Highly Structured Environments – They hate blindly following...anything...without understanding why. They have a greater dislike for authority figures who go around forcing others to obey laws and rules without understanding the purpose of the standards themselves. They are likely not to get along with anyone who prefers how things “have always been.” However, by not going along with the standards – even when doing so might not be a big deal – They can make their lives harder than they need to be."
INTJ,"Clueless in Romance – This resentment toward rules and their tendency to overanalyze and judge, even to the point of arrogance, adds up to a personality type often clueless in dating. Having a new relationship last long enough for They to understand what is going on and how to behave is difficult. Trying harder in the ways that They are used to can only make things worse, and, unfortunately, it’s common for them to simply give up the search for love. Ironically, this more-relaxed state is when they’re at their best, and only then are they most likely to attract that special someone without effort."
INTJ,"In romance, people with the XXXX personality type approach things the way they do most situations: they create a well-designed plan with precise expectations and the right end goal. Here, the goal is a healthy long-term relationship. They rarely fall head over heels in love in a way that involves spontaneous passion and romance. They find potential partners who meet certain established criteria, break the dating process down into measurable steps, then complete the plan with great precision."
INTJ,"In a purely rational world, this would be foolproof. However, it ignores important factors that They are likely to easily dismiss, such as human nature."
INTJ,"People with the XXXX personality type are intellectual, always developing a world in their heads that is more perfect than reality. Other people entering their worlds need to fit this fantasy in some way – even if only by agreeing with their concepts. It can be incredibly difficult for They to find someone up to the task. Finding a compatible partner is the most significant challenge the majority of They will face in life."
INTJ,"Sentiment, tradition, and emotion are They’ weaknesses, and social gestures that seem not to have a clear purpose are often viewed by They as silly, even insulting. The problem is that common, ritualistic dating practices grew over time to make introductions between potential partners easier. They help couples gradually develop a connection. They’ liking for directness and honesty, in both word and deed, often go against these unspoken social agreements and niceties. This can make dating difficult for them."
INTJ,"As they mature, They often come to see romantic rituals as important. But until they do, it can be risky, especially for Turbulent They. If they are shot down too many times when younger, they may decide that everyone else is too irrational or beneath them intellectually. If cynicism takes hold, XXXX personalities may begin to show off their intellectual superiority – as they place themselves above such “silliness.” Being alone then becomes their unintentional choice – a kind of surrender to a life without love."
INTJ,"The positive side of They’ “giving up” is that they are most attractive when they aren’t trying to be attractive, most appealing when they are doing what they do best. Generally, that means working in a familiar environment where their confidence and intelligence can shine. Allowing others to come to them is often They’ best strategy. Then, if they believe a relationship has potential, they will spare no effort in developing and maintaining stability and long-term satisfaction."
INTJ,"Once a relationship begins, an XXXX’s significant other will find an imaginative and enthusiastic companion. They typically give a huge amount of freedom to the people they love, and are often trusting partners. People with the XXXX personality type may never be very comfortable sharing their feelings, and they may spend more time thinking about love than expressing it. But, using their strategic thinking, they usually figure out how to make a situation work for everyone – including the act of falling in love."
INTJ,"But when it comes to emotional satisfaction, They are often out of their element. Not every partner likes addressing conflicts and emotional needs as cold puzzles to be analyzed and solved like They do."
INTJ,"Sometimes emotions need to be expressed for their own sake, and putting every outburst under the microscope, as They are prone to do, isn’t always helpful. If outbursts become a habit needing constant attention, or They think they may, these personalities can simply end the relationship. They’ll see this as more rational than dragging things out to their exhausting conclusion."
INTJ,"They value depth and intelligence, bringing stability and insight into their romantic relationships. They prize honest communication, and everything in a relationship is open to discussion and change. But this must be returned by their partners."
INTJ,"They do what they think is right regardless of feelings, and sometimes that comes across as cold. It’s important for their partners to know that They don’t make these decisions lightly. They spend tremendous time and energy trying to understand why and how things go wrong, and they hurt deeply when things fall apart. This is especially true if they’ve taken the difficult risk of committing themselves."
INTJ,"Their challenge is finding partners who share those same values. While no personality type is excluded from this, each provides its own unique challenges. It can be important for They to feel like they’re on common footing on at least a few fronts, making some shared traits a potentially important factor. But they shouldn’t necessarily go around looking for another XXXX. Each opposing trait brings the opportunity for great personal growth."
INTJ,"Having one or two counter-balancing personality traits – such as Extraverted (E), Observant (S), Feeling (F), or Prospecting (P) – can help keep a relationship dynamic and growth-oriented. They challenge They to remain involved with other people, focus on the present, get in touch with their emotions, and stay open to things they’re not used to. To a type so intent on their own development, these differences can make all the difference."
INTJ,"They tend to have more success in developing friendships than they do with romantic relationships, but they have many of the same difficulties with both. They too often put rational processes in place of emotional availability. This intellectual distance tends to go both ways. They are difficult for others to get to know. And they don’t always want to bother with anyone else they believe isn’t on their level. Avoiding these potholes is nearly impossible – except for the instant connection often made when potential friends share the Intuitive personality trait."
INTJ,"They tend to have strong opinions about what works, what doesn’t, what they’re looking for, and what they’re not. This can come across as arrogance. But They would argue it’s a basic filtering tool that allows them to focus more effectively."
INTJ,"In friendship, people with the XXXX personality type are looking for an intellectual soulmate more than anything else. People who aren’t equipped for such a relationship are seen as boring. They need to share their expansive ideas; making chronic small talk is something they typically avoid."
INTJ,"Further, having more than just a few friends may compromise They’ sense of independence and self-sufficiency. They gladly give up popularity to ensure this freedom. This need for freedom even applies to the few who fit the They’ criteria for friendship. Their relationships need little attention or upkeep to remain on good terms. They encourage everyone in their lives to enjoy the same independence."
INTJ,"With emotional support, They are far from being good at offering comfort. They expect their friends to do the same. When emotional situations happen, They may have no clue how to handle them. They may have no idea what to do. This sudden cluelessness goes against their usual ability to calmly and rationally make decisions and can seriously throw them off-kilter."
INTJ,"When they are in their comfort zone, though, among people they know and respect, XXXX personalities have no trouble relaxing and enjoying themselves. Their sarcasm and dark humor aren’t for everyone – especially those who struggle to read between the lines – but these types provide fascinating stories for those who can keep up."
INTJ,"It’s not always easy to become friends with They. Rather than the usual social rules and behaviors, They look for friends who value intellect, honesty, and a wish to grow and learn. They are bright and always want to improve themselves, and expect their friends to share this attitude. Anyone falling short of this is labeled a bore. But anyone with these qualities likely appreciates They as well, forming strong and exciting friendships that stand the test of time."
INTJ,"Parenting, like so many other person-to-person relationships, is a challenge for people with the XXXX personality type. Being so devoted to rational thought, logic, and analyzing cause and effect, They aren’t always prepared to deal with people who haven’t developed these same abilities – like children. But these parents can’t walk away from their still-learning offspring as they might a clueless adult. Luckily, They thrive on committing to long-term projects. This may be especially true for a lifelong project as meaningful as parenthood."
INTJ,"XXXX parents aren’t prone to give as much warmth as the classic images of parenting suggest they should. They are often insensitive and not prone to displays of affection. But children need cuddling and other expressions of love, especially during the younger years. And if They have children who are more sensitive, they may carelessly step on their feelings trying to make sense of things. It can take a clear effort on their part to transform their colder traits into something warmer and more child-friendly."
INTJ,"Even less sensitive children need emotional support occasionally. This is especially true of adolescents. They, even more than other Analyst types, have trouble handling their own emotions. They often struggle to be much help as their children grow into theirs."
INTJ,"They also tend to avoid tackling a problem that doesn’t go along a well-defined path to a definitive answer – and emotional issues sometimes don’t. They are strongest when finding a root cause and developing a plan to solve a problem. But sometimes the best solution to a kid’s problem is just sitting with the child as they explore their feelings."
INTJ,"They also recognize that life is often the best teacher, and they tend to be a bit more liberal with boundaries, allowing their children to have their own adventures and make many of their own decisions. They believe in developing their critical thinking skills. This isn’t to say that XXXX parents are lenient – far from it. Rather, they expect their children to use their freedom responsibly, and this expectation alone is enough for parent and child to develop mutually appreciated ground rules."
INTJ,"When necessary, XXXX parents speak openly with their children. They typically believe in honesty and that knowing the truth is better than not knowing it. They hold tight to the idea that being right is far better than being wrong and, for better or worse, pass this attitude on to their children."
INTJ,"If their children accept their approach to parenting, they begin to trust and respect their XXXX parents. XXXX personalities are excellent communicators when they want to be. They frame problems as opportunities for personal growth. They help their children develop their own style of rational thinking and problem-solving. With their parents’ guidance, children can apply this to more and more complex situations, building their confidence as they grow. They try to make sure that their children are prepared to deal with anything life throws at them."
INTJ,"All this comes from They’ core philosophy of intelligent self-direction. These personalities try to mold their children in their own image. They work to raise capable adults who can use their own minds, solve their own problems, and help their own children do the same when the time comes. They understand this can’t happen if they protect their children from every difficult or unpleasant thing in life. But then, they believe that if they give their children the right tools, they won’t have to."
INTJ,"Professional know-how is often where They shine most brilliantly. They easily take in complex principles and techniques and change them into clear and actionable strategies. No other personality type comes close to their ability to assess and organize concepts."
INTJ,"They can usually sort out the “noise” of a situation, then find the core thread that needs to be pulled to unravel messes – which they then put back together again. In the process, they produce the most elegant solutions to problems. As they grow, their confidence, enthusiasm, and creativity typically lead them to more interesting work. In time, they are likely to earn the independence they typically desire."
INTJ,"The real problem for They is that they need their new and creative ideas to be heard. They need to have someone in charge listen to them. But forming relationships with people who make decisions is not exactly part of the They’ core strengths. In their early careers, They often have to do boring tasks that don’t challenge them and deal with having their ideas repeatedly rejected. But, with time, they are likely to develop their abilities into skill sets so effective that they get noticed."
INTJ,"People with the XXXX personality type usually prefer to work alone or in small groups. There, they can make the most of their creativity and focus without constant interruptions from curious coworkers or supervisors who call too many meetings. They are unlikely to be drawn to management roles or anything that involves nonstop interaction and teamwork, often preferring more “lone wolf” jobs. They like a drawing board more than a boardroom meeting. Like so many others, They get along best with leaders who understand their style of working and can help advance their visions."
INTJ,"The other side of that coin is that They dislike anyone who gets ahead by playing the office politics game well or working a company’s social scene just right. They judge their coworkers by what they can do and not who they know. They have high standards – if they view a colleague or supervisor as being not up to those standards or otherwise ineffective, respect can be instantly and permanently lost."
INTJ,"People with the XXXX personality type value personal resourcefulness, grit, insight, and commitment in themselves and in others. They believe that everyone should complete their work and meet the highest possible standards. If a social butterfly at work breezes through without carrying their own weight, they may find They using their ingenuity to find ways to stop their nonsense."
INTJ,"As their careers progress further and their reputations grow, so will the difficulty of the tasks and projects They are offered. XXXX personalities demand progress and evolution, and they love to explore new ideas. They often satisfy this by pushing themselves into more active strategic positions. While they don’t care for the spotlight, They do enjoy controlling their ideas. They often take on low-profile but influential roles as project managers, systems engineers, marketing strategists, systems analysts, and military strategists."
INTJ,"But really, They’ vision, creativity, and skill in carrying out their plans make these personalities possible candidates for just about any career. Some careers, such as sales and human resources, don’t necessarily play to their strengths, but that shouldn’t stop them if they decide to take up these kinds of work. They have the qualities necessary to work in just about any organization if they decide to. And if they find nothing out in the world, they usually have in abundance what it takes to start their own businesses."
INTJ,"They want to tackle intellectually interesting work with little outside interference. They want no more and no less. Time-consuming management techniques like trust-building gatherings, progress meetings, and long sessions that look backward rather than forward only annoy They. All they need – be they subordinates, colleagues, or managers – is to meet their goals with the highest standard of technical excellence. And it may help them if they’re surrounded by people who share those values – if anyone surrounds them."
INTJ,"On paper, this makes them appear to be model employees. In many ways, they are. But a lot of personality types will find working with They challenging. They have a strict code of conduct when they work. If they see coworkers valuing social activities and accepting “good enough” workmanship over excellence, there’s likely to be trouble. They prefer to work in tight, like-minded groups – and a group of one is just fine with this type."
INTJ,"XXXX personalities are independent people. They can become frustrated if they find themselves pushed into roles that limit their freedom. With the direction of an open-minded manager, They can set themselves up as experts and earn some of their desired independence. They appreciate straightforward, no-nonsense managers. They respect those who lead competently, deliver thoughtful criticism when necessary, and back their decisions with clear logic. And they respect superiors even more when they then step back and give They room to work."
INTJ,"Note that it’s They’ expectations of their managers being defined here, and not the other way around, as with some other personality types. Titles mean little to They, and they rarely work just to impress a boss. Trust and respect are earned, and They expect this to be a two-way street, with all receiving and delivering advice and criticism and all bringing about results. They expect their managers to be intelligent enough and strong enough to handle this relationship. A silent XXXX conveys a lack of respect better than all their challenges ever could."
INTJ,"Active teamwork is not ideal for people with the XXXX personality type. Independent and private, They use their quick minds and insight to turn aside distractions, and they rarely take part in much personal talk or office drama. They often foster work environments where they aren’t slowed down by those less intelligent, less capable, or less adaptable to their more efficient methods. They feel no need to bring their colleagues along if they aren’t going to be helpful."
INTJ,"They typically gather a small group of trusted colleagues into their brainstorming sessions. They rarely invite coworkers who get too hung up on details, or who have not yet earned their respect. But, more likely, They simply go it alone. Their perfectionism and resolve usually mean they produce effective results and clean solutions. These successes give those with the XXXX personality type both the time alone they need and the sense of victory they enjoy."
INTJ,"Though they may be surprised to hear it, XXXX personalities can make great leaders. They value innovation and effectiveness more than just about any other quality. They are happy to throw aside the chain of command in favor of effective workflow, recognizing that artificial respect for their authority isn’t necessarily going to bring about good results. Solutions are more important than positions to this type. Whatever works rules the day for these managers."
INTJ,"They promote freedom and flexibility in the workplace, and they prefer to treat those who work for them as equals, respecting and rewarding proactive behavior. Their attitudes as managers can be summed up by the phrase, “To the best minds go the responsibilities.” They prefer to direct broader strategies while letting more hands-on workers manage day-to-day activities."
INTJ,"But this freedom isn’t just granted – it’s required. Those who are used to just being told what to do – who can’t direct themselves or challenge existing ideas – have a hard time meeting They’ high standards. Efficiency and results are kings to They, and behaviors that chip away at these standards are likely crushed. If workers attempt to make up for their poor results by trying to win their XXXX boss over with flattery or social attention, they are likely to be disappointed. Those things rarely work with They."
INTJ,"Armed with a powerful intellect and strategic thinking, They can overcome or outmaneuver obstacles that seem unbeatable to most. Their many quirks, such as an often unconstrained rationalism, lead to many misunderstandings. Those misunderstandings end here. What you have read so far is just an introduction – we have a great deal more to tell you about the XXXX personality type."
INTP,"XXXX (XXXX) is someone with the Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Prospecting personality traits. These flexible thinkers enjoy taking an unconventional approach to many aspects of life. They often seek out unlikely paths, mixing willingness to experiment with personal creativity."
INTP,"The XXXX personality type is fairly rare, making up only three percent of the population, which is definitely a good thing for them, as there’s nothing they’d be more unhappy about than being “common”. They pride themselves on their inventiveness and creativity, their unique perspective and vigorous intellect. Usually known as the philosopher, the architect, or the dreamy professor, They have been responsible for many scientific discoveries throughout history."
INTP,"They love patterns, and spotting discrepancies between statements could almost be described as a hobby, making it a bad idea to lie to a XXXX. This makes it ironic that They’ word should always be taken with a grain of salt – it’s not that they are dishonest, but people with the XXXX personality type tend to share thoughts that are not fully developed, using others as a sounding board for ideas and theories in a debate against themselves rather than as actual conversation partners."
INTP,"This may make them appear unreliable, but in reality no one is more enthusiastic and capable of spotting a problem, drilling through the endless factors and details that encompass the issue and developing a unique and viable solution than They – just don’t expect punctual progress reports. People who share the XXXX personality type aren’t interested in practical, day-to-day activities and maintenance, but when they find an environment where their creative genius and potential can be expressed, there is no limit to the time and energy They will expend in developing an insightful and unbiased solution."
INTP,"They may appear to drift about in an unending daydream, but They’ thought process is unceasing, and their minds buzz with ideas from the moment they wake up. This constant thinking can have the effect of making them look pensive and detached, as they are often conducting full-fledged debates in their own heads, but really They are quite relaxed and friendly when they are with people they know, or who share their interests. However, this can be replaced by overwhelming shyness when XXXX personalities are among unfamiliar faces, and friendly banter can quickly become combative if they believe their logical conclusions or theories are being criticized."
INTP,"When They are particularly excited, the conversation can border on incoherence as they try to explain the daisy-chain of logical conclusions that led to the formation of their latest idea. Oftentimes, They will opt to simply move on from a topic before it’s ever understood what they were trying to say, rather than try to lay things out in plain terms."
INTP,"The reverse can also be true when people explain their thought processes to They in terms of subjectivity and feeling. Imagine an immensely complicated clockwork, taking in every fact and idea possible, processing them with a heavy dose of creative reasoning and returning the most logically sound results available – this is how the XXXX mind works, and this type has little tolerance for an emotional monkey-wrench jamming their machines."
INTP,"Further, They are unlikely to understand emotional complaints at all, and their friends won’t find a bedrock of emotional support in them. People with the XXXX personality type would much rather make a series of logical suggestions for how to resolve the underlying issue, a perspective that is not always welcomed by their more sensitive companions. This will likely extend to most social conventions and goals as well, like planning dinners and getting married, as They are far more concerned with originality and efficient results."
INTP,"The one thing that really holds They back is their restless and pervasive fear of failure. XXXX personalities are so prone to reassessing their own thoughts and theories, worrying that they’ve missed some critical piece of the puzzle, that they can stagnate, lost in an intangible world where their thoughts are never truly applied. Overcoming this self-doubt stands as the greatest challenge They are likely to face, but the intellectual gifts – big and small – bestowed on the world when they do makes it worth the fight.. Great Analysts and Abstract Thinkers – People with the XXXX personality type view the world as a big, complex machine, and recognize that as with any machine, all parts are interrelated. They excel in analyzing these connections, seeing how seemingly unrelated factors tie in with each other in ways that bewilder most other personality types.. Imaginative and Original – These connections are the product of an unrelenting imagination – They’ ideas may seem counter-intuitive at a glance, and may never even see the light of day, but they will always prove remarkable innovations.. Open-Minded – They couldn’t make these connections if they thought they knew it all – they are highly receptive to alternate theories, so long as they’re supported by logic and facts. In more subjective matters like social norms and traditions, They are usually fairly liberal, with a “none of my business” sort of attitude – peoples’ ideas are what matter.. Enthusiastic – When a new idea piques their interest, They can be very enthusiastic – they are a reserved personality type, but if another person shares an interest, they can be downright excited about discussing it. More likely though, the only outward evidence of this enthusiasm will be They’ silent pacing or their staring into the distance.. Objective – They’ analysis, creativity and open-mindedness aren’t the tools of some quest for ideology or emotional validation. Rather, it’s as though people with the XXXX personality type are a conduit for the truths around them, so far as they can be expressed, and they are proud of this role as theoretical mediator.. Honest and Straightforward – To know one thing and say another would be terribly disingenuous – They don’t often go around intentionally hurting feelings, but they believe that the truth is the most important factor, and they expect that to be appreciated and reciprocated.. Very Private and Withdrawn – While They’ intellectualism yields many insights into their surroundings, their surroundings are ironically considered an intrusion on their thoughts. This is especially true with people – They are quite shy in social settings. More complicated situations such as parties exacerbate this, but even close friends struggle to get into They’ hearts and minds.. Insensitive – Oftentimes XXXX personalities get so caught up in their logic that they forget any kind of emotional consideration – they dismiss subjectivity as irrational and tradition as an attempt to bar much-needed progress. Purely emotional situations are often utterly puzzling to They, and their lack of timely sympathy can easily offend.. Absent-minded – When They’ interest is captured, their absence goes beyond social matters to include the rest of the physical world. They become forgetful, missing even the obvious if it’s unrelated to their current infatuation, and they can even forget their own health, skipping meals and sleep as they muse.. Condescending – Attempts at connecting with others are often worse than They’ withdrawal. People with the XXXX personality type take pride in their knowledge and rationale, and enjoy sharing their ideas, but in trying to explain how they got from A to B to Z, they can get frustrated, sometimes simplifying things to the point of insult as they struggle to gauge their conversation partners’ perspective. The ultimate insult comes as They give up with a dismissive “never mind”.. Loathe Rules and Guidelines – These social struggles are partly a product of They’ desire to bypass the rules, of social conduct and otherwise. While this attitude helps They’ strength of unconventional creativity, it also causes them to reinvent the wheel constantly and to shun security in favor of autonomy in ways that can compromise both.. Second-Guess Themselves – They remain so open to new information that they often never commit to a decision at all. This applies to their own skills as well – XXXX personalities know that as they practice, they improve, and any work they do is second-best to what they could do. Unable to settle for this, They sometimes delay their output indefinitely with constant revisions, sometimes even quitting before they ever begin."
INTP,"When it comes to romantic relationships, They have an interesting mixture of traits that often pleasantly surprise their partners. People with this personality type are always full of ideas, but they have few opportunities to explore their more romantic notions. As with any of their theories, They love sharing with others, and in finally meeting someone where romantic thoughts are appropriate, they show themselves to be excited, enthusiastic, and even playful, flirting with word-play and intellectual games."
INTP,"None of this is to say that these relationships come easily to They – they are shy and withdrawn individuals, and getting out and meeting new people, risking rejection and making themselves the center of attention in emotionally delicate situations are far from being their strengths. It is more likely that XXXX personalities will leave a trail of breadcrumbs for a potential partner, allowing them to make the first move and committing to their partner as an act of reciprocation rather than bravado."
INTP,"From the start, They take their relationships seriously – their imagination and vision, and the challenge of getting to know new people, make them all too aware of how important it is that they’re involved with someone, and they will prove themselves surprisingly loyal. Even early in the dating phase, They are unusually direct and honest, doing their best to express their mindset and create mutual understanding, believing that this shared knowledge will help to minimize misunderstandings and avoid conflict."
INTP,"As their relationships progress, They’ daily needs prove remarkably simple. Gifts, surprises, complex social plans and date nights are all fairly unimportant to people with the XXXX personality type, but this is also one of their chiefest weaknesses – their partner may very much need these things, and it won’t even occur to They to plan them out. For all their analysis and attempts at mutual understanding, They are notoriously bad at picking up on others’ emotional needs."
INTP,"When these conflicts do arise and are inescapable, They will do their best to find a logical solution. But this hardly helps if the problem is logic itself, that XXXX personalities aren’t meeting their partners’ emotional needs. They should keep this in mind, and try to meet their partners halfway by communicating on an emotional level – if they make this effort, understanding partners will recognize and appreciate the gesture, clumsy though it may be. After all, they need to afford They the same benefit, and meet them halfway with logic and simplicity as well."
INTP,"All this material asceticism and conflict avoidance support one primary goal – to free up mental resources for more important things. They’ creative, vivid imagination make for a surprisingly enthusiastic, passionate, and romantic partner. While They may prioritize their inner world too much, imagining interesting and exciting intimate situations that are never expressed to their partners, they also use this rich inner world to achieve as much as possible in intimacy – they rarely want for ideas."
INTP,"Physically, intellectually and with a little effort emotionally, XXXX relationships are rich and rewarding connections. Partners who share the Intuitive (N) trait are usually best, along with one or two opposite traits to create variety and balance, but so long as They remember that they are with people who have their own, independent wants and needs, and so long as their partners remember the same of their They, these are long-lasting and satisfying relationships."
INTP,"Many of the usual motivations for making friends – emotional support, social validation, shared routine – simply don’t apply to They. More likely, these concepts are met with disdain, as people with the XXXX personality type prize intellectual depth above all else. It is not easy to become good friends with They, but if there is a common interest and a common train of thought, the connection is likely to spark instantly, surprising everyone else who thought they had this distant personality type pegged."
INTP,"XXXX friendships are knowledge-based, defined by the exchange of ideas, theories, and concepts, and those who aren’t able to keep up with this, or who have sharply differing tastes (don’t talk to They about celebrities) will find stony faces that border on rude. To They, communication is often more of a nuisance than a pleasure, and conversation is reserved for topics that they find meaningful, or for people they already like enough to stick it out."
INTP,"Other Analyst personalities are a natural fit for They, who share their passion for new ideas, riddles and solutions. People with the XXXX personality type are knowledgeable and intelligent, and have a great deal of respect for those who can keep them on their toes in this regard. They will gladly help to tackle any dilemma thrown their way, offering up sound advice and rational solutions. As valuable as these qualities are though, they are not always the best approach – when it comes to emotional support or advice in dealing with matters of the heart, They are at a loss."
INTP,"It’s not that XXXX personalities don’t feel – quite the contrary, they actually have very strong sentiments. But this is not their strongest suit, making They’ emotional reactions strong, untrustworthy and naturally in need of being tempered by their well-trained logic and rationalism."
INTP,"While they may not be able to help directly with these sorts of problems, They help indirectly with unambiguous and reliable friendships. They’ friends need never worry about power games or emotional baggage – they are liked for their minds and abilities, not their status or possessions. While it may not be easy to establish true friendships with XXXX personalities, once the link is made, they will provide years of understanding and thought-stimulating ideas, making them well worth the effort."
INTP,"In parenting roles, as with many social roles, They find themselves facing a robust but healthy challenge. Not a naturally sensitive type, XXXX personalities struggle to identify with the raw emotions and irrationality that are often the standard with young children, who have yet to develop the sort of self-control and logical thinking that They take for granted."
INTP,"People with the XXXX personality type are nevertheless incredibly devoted – perhaps not in the traditional, emotionally supportive sense, but they are parents who are committed to encouraging their growing children to think and act independently, seek out new knowledge, and voice and defend their own opinions."
INTP,"For They, knowledge is key, and they will do their best to give their children the tolerance and freedom necessary to acquire it. XXXX parents take a relaxed, intellectual approach towards their children, allowing them to explore the world around them and overlooking the more minor offences along the way."
INTP,"XXXX personalities are not particularly demanding parents, at least not in the sense that they expect their children to live a traditional life of school > career > marriage > house > kids > retirement (and in that order, thank you very much). Rather, XXXX parents are demanding in an intellectual sense – they want their children to ask if this path is the best path for them, and how to go about following a different one if they need to. This level of personal freedom can be daunting, and can take a long time to come to terms with, but XXXX parents are prepared to stand by their children with support and advice for as long as they need."
INTP,"While there is hardly a better parent for having rational, intelligent discussions with their children, there is hardly a clumsier example when it comes to providing the emotional support that many children need, especially as they approach their teenage years. In this area, They will need to either rely on a more capable partner, or to take themselves far out of their comfort zone in order to empathize without trying to clear away the tears with an endless series of rational suggestions and blunt truths."
INTP,"They want nothing more than for their children to grow up smart, independent, and tolerant, but if they want them to be well-adjusted too, they must make this effort. They’ parenting style affords a great deal of latitude for their children, but with this freedom comes responsibility, and it is They’ responsibility to ensure that it is used constructively. Though it’s a challenge for people with the XXXX personality type to teach empathy alongside rationality, if they are able to pull it off, their children will grow into confident adults who know how to ask questions, use their minds, and take care of themselves no matter what comes their way."
INTP,"They are solitary, eccentric, and independent – none of which is listed as desirable for corporate positions, which are usually designed for very different personality types. They duly struggle in finding careers that meet their needs, but what they do bring, qualities in much higher demand, are creativity, a passion for theoretical methods and ideas, and an entrepreneurial, innovative spirit. If they are able to put this better foot forward to secure a position in a suitable line of work, people with the XXXX personality type will find that, whatever the job listing says, these “less desirable” qualities will prove an asset after all."
INTP,"Chief among They’ interests is exploring and building models for underlying principles and ideas, even going so far as to find these concepts, in their own way, beautiful – this makes them natural mathematicians, systems analysts, and career scientists, especially in more abstract fields such as physics. There are many other careers that allow They to explore these interests, but many of them are far too rooted in uninteresting practical applications. As useful as it is to develop a better vacuum cleaner, it is no Large Hadron Collider."
INTP,"XXXX personalities are self-driven and have very high personal standards – “good enough” is never good enough – but have few environmental needs. Despite this relative simplicity, they are often hard for more people-centric types to understand. They live primarily in their own heads, and have little interest in social distractions like chitchat and motivational speeches."
INTP,"For this reason, the flatter the workplace hierarchy, the better, making small, technical workplaces and fields such as law, forensics, and laboratory research very desirable for They. Insightful and open-minded managers who can accommodate these needs will find their XXXX subordinates to be a tireless generator of brilliant and unique ideas. However, many people with the XXXX personality type may do away with the immediate hierarchy altogether, opting instead to provide their services on a freelance basis as consultants."
INTP,"Where They do not thrive is in workplaces that require them to provide a high degree of emotional satisfaction – cruise ship masseuses they are not. XXXX personalities struggle to understand emotional exchanges, and service-oriented positions will prove baffling and exhausting for them. Though They are talented analysts who are perfectly capable of understanding the theoretical importance of customer service, the day-to-day application of such a scheme is simply better left to more people-oriented personality types."
INTP,"Business is growing more complex every day, and this complexity is managed with technical systems, economic theories, and data. The need for novel approaches is stronger than ever for people and organizations to distinguish themselves. Though general people skills are often phrased as a must, it is the technical work that creates something to talk about, and it is in this pursuit that They thrive."
INTP,"Work as business analysts and corporate strategists is well suited to They, but they can also move things forward as data analysts, mechanical, electrical and software engineers, and even as technical writers and journalists, provided the field is interesting enough. If they can smile and shake hands just long enough to establish themselves as the brilliant innovators that they are, people with the XXXX personality type will find that whatever the expectations for social conduct, it is the qualities unique to them that are truly in demand."
INTP,"The running theme for They is their desire for solitude, need for intellectual stimulation, and the satisfaction of the final piece of a puzzle clicking into place. Whether in subordinate or management positions, with colleagues or working alone, these privileges and the freedom to pursue them unfettered by social obligations and progress reports are about all people with the XXXX personality type look for in their workplace."
INTP,"Though They may scoff at the notion, they actually function best when paired with another person. Their position determines which personality type best fits their needs, but They’ tendency to live in their heads and vent inspiration and creativity seemingly at random demands the presence of an implementer to ensure that no stroke of genius goes unnoticed."
INTP,"Under the right conditions, XXXX subordinates are innovative, resourceful, and hard-working, easily wrapping their minds around whatever complex problems are placed in front of them and delivering unorthodox but effective solutions. However, these qualities require a great deal of freedom, something stereotypical managers are loath to cede. It is difficult to quantify these qualities on a resume – several other characteristics, like a relative indifference to job security and to being liked, exacerbate the challenge – and it can take time to grow to trust XXXX subordinates enough to allow this latitude."
INTP,"XXXX personalities prefer to work alone, but at the same time they despise “grunt-work”. Their focus on conceiving new and exciting ideas and ignoring the details of execution means that They need someone alongside to keep things in order and actually put into practice their often unrefined ideas. Such a condition can’t be forced on They, but a few logically phrased criticisms (certainly not emotional appeals or pep talks about working as part of a team) and clever management can make it happen."
INTP,"For They, colleagues aren’t so much a group of people who they socialize and work with as they are a series of obstacles and diversions with occasionally useful knowledge. Mingling, chitchat, drinks after work – these make They want to work alone, not get up in the morning. Despite this distance, people with the XXXX personality type are unusually good at developing insightful and unbiased interpretations of others’ motivations, though sometimes they overthink it, becoming unnecessarily suspicious of others’ goals."
INTP,"What they do enjoy are riddles and patterns, and any XXXX would be proud to be the guru who is sought after as arbiter on the validity of an idea, or for their insight on how to apply a principle to novel situations. They love discussing theories, at least with “proven” colleagues, and are almost always available as impromptu consultants. This, however, does not apply to emotional riddles and conflicts, They’ Achilles Heel – in these charged situations, XXXX personalities have no clue what to do."
INTP,"While They don’t care for managing other people, it is likely the most rewarding position as it provides the opportunity to direct concepts and theories while others handle the logistics. They have a very tolerant and flexible style, characterized by an openness to logical suggestions and relative freedom for their subordinates. But this freedom comes at a cost – XXXX managers have very high standards, and they expect others to grasp their insights instantly, and to provide their own in equal measure."
INTP,"As well as their demand for innovation, They are better than any other type at noticing logical discrepancies – their tendency to ignore others’ feelings means that their criticisms often come hard .and fast as they direct projects to their own perfectionistic standards. Here again They do best with a partner, this time a delegator who can filter their thoughts and direct their team in more socially productive ways. A liaison can also help to deter schmoozing and attempts at emotional manipulation, a sure mistake for anyone who tries."
INTP,"Armed with a powerful intellect and vivid imagination, They can overcome or outmaneuver obstacles that seem unbeatable to most. At the same time, their many quirks, such as often unconstrained rationalism, lead to many misunderstandings. Those misunderstandings end here. What you have read so far is just an introduction – we have a great deal more to tell you about the XXXX personality type."
ENTJ,"XXXX (XXXX) is someone with the Extraverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Judging personality traits. They are decisive people who love momentum and accomplishment. They gather information to construct their creative visions but rarely hesitate for long before acting on them."
ENTJ,"They are natural-born leaders. People with this personality type embody the gifts of charisma and confidence, and project authority in a way that draws crowds together behind a common goal. However, They are also characterized by an often ruthless level of rationality, using their drive, determination and sharp minds to achieve whatever end they’ve set for themselves. Perhaps it is best that they make up only three percent of the population, lest they overwhelm the more timid and sensitive personality types that make up much of the rest of the world – but we have They to thank for many of the businesses and institutions we take for granted every day."
ENTJ,"If there’s anything They love, it’s a good challenge, big or small, and they firmly believe that given enough time and resources, they can achieve any goal. This quality makes people with the XXXX personality type brilliant entrepreneurs, and their ability to think strategically and hold a long-term focus while executing each step of their plans with determination and precision makes them powerful business leaders. This determination is often a self-fulfilling prophecy, as They push their goals through with sheer willpower where others might give up and move on, and their Extraverted (E) nature means they are likely to push everyone else right along with them, achieving spectacular results in the process."
ENTJ,"At the negotiating table, be it in a corporate environment or buying a car, They are dominant, relentless, and unforgiving. This isn’t because they are coldhearted or vicious per Xx – it’s more that XXXX personalities genuinely enjoy the challenge, the battle of wits, the repartee that comes from this environment, and if the other side can’t keep up, that’s no reason for They to fold on their own core tenet of ultimate victory."
ENTJ,"If there’s anyone They respect, it’s someone who is able to stand up to them intellectually, who is able to act with a precision and quality equal to their own. XXXX personalities have a particular skill in recognizing the talents of others, and this helps in both their team-building efforts (since no one, no matter how brilliant, can do everything alone), and to keep They from displaying too much arrogance and condescension. However, they also have a particular skill in calling out others’ failures with a chilling degree of insensitivity, and this is where They really start to run into trouble."
ENTJ,"Emotional expression isn’t the strong suit of any Analyst type, but They’ distance from their emotions is especially public, and felt directly by a much broader swath of people. Especially in a professional environment, They will simply crush the sensitivities of those they view as inefficient, incompetent or lazy. To people with the XXXX personality type, emotional displays are displays of weakness, and it’s easy to make enemies with this approach – They will do well to remember that they absolutely depend on having a functioning team, not just to achieve their goals, but for their validation and feedback as well, something They are, curiously, very sensitive to."
ENTJ,"They are true powerhouses, and they cultivate an image of being larger than life – and often enough they are. They need to remember though, that their stature comes not just from their own actions, but from the actions of the team that props them up, and that it’s important to recognize the contributions, talents and needs, especially from an emotional perspective, of their support network. Even if they have to adopt a 'fake it ‘til you make it' mentality, if They are able to combine an emotionally healthy focus alongside their many strengths, they will be rewarded with deep, satisfying relationships and all the challenging victories they can handle.. Efficient – They see inefficiency not just as a problem in its own right, but as something that pulls time and energy away from all their future goals, an elaborate sabotage consisting of irrationality and laziness. People with the XXXX personality type will root out such behavior wherever they go.. Energetic – Rather than finding this process taxing They are energized by it, genuinely enjoying leading their teams forward as they implement their plans and goals.. Self-Confident – They couldn’t do this if they were plagued by self-doubt – they trust their abilities, make known their opinions, and believe in their capacities as leaders.. Strong-Willed – Nor do they give up when the going gets tough – XXXX personalities strive to achieve their goals, but really nothing is quite as satisfying to them as rising to the challenge of each obstacle in their run to the finish line.. Strategic Thinkers – They exemplify the difference between moment-to-moment crisis management and navigating the challenges and steps of a bigger plan, and are known for examining every angle of a problem and not just resolving momentary issues, but moving the whole project forward with their solutions.. Charismatic and Inspiring – These qualities combine to create individuals who are able to inspire and invigorate others, who people actually want to be their leaders, and this in turn helps They to accomplish their often ambitious goals that could never be finished alone."
ENTJ,"Stubborn and Dominant – Sometimes all this confidence and willpower can go too far, and They are all too capable of digging in their heels, trying to win every single debate and pushing their vision, and theirs alone.. Intolerant – “It’s my way or the highway” – People with the XXXX personality type are notoriously unsupportive of any idea that distracts from their primary goals, and even more so of ideas based on emotional considerations. They won’t hesitate a second to make that fact clear to those around them.. Impatient – Some people need more time to think than others, an intolerable delay to quick-thinking They. They may misinterpret contemplation as stupidity or disinterest in their haste, a terrible mistake for a leader to make.. Arrogant – XXXX personalities respect quick thoughts and firm convictions, their own qualities, and look down on those who don’t match up. This relationship is a challenge for most other personality types who are perhaps not timid in their own right, but will seem so beside overbearing They.. Poor Handling of Emotions – All this bluster, alongside the assumed supremacy of rationalism, makes They distant from their own emotional expression and sometimes downright scornful of others’. People with this personality type often trample others’ feelings, inadvertently hurting their partners and friends, especially in emotionally charged situations.. Cold and Ruthless – Their obsession with efficiency and unwavering belief in the merits of rationalism, especially professionally, makes They incredibly insensitive in pursuing their goals, dismissing personal circumstances, sensitivities, and preferences as irrational and irrelevant."
ENTJ,"As in other areas of their lives, They approach dating and relationships with a set of goals and a plan to achieve them, and proceed to do so with impressive energy and enthusiasm. People with the XXXX personality type are in it to win, and will gladly take leading roles in relationships from the start, assuming personal responsibility for how smoothly things go and working actively to ensure a mutually rewarding experience. Romantic relationships are a serious business, and They are in it for the long haul."
ENTJ,"This sense of personal responsibility means that They put a lot of energy into their relationships, and they show their creativity by always having something new on the agenda to keep things interesting, especially in the dating phase. At the same time though, XXXX personalities keep their eyes on the long term, and if they determine that a relationship is heading towards a dead end, they will cut their losses and move on in what will seem to their partner an abrupt end to the attention they had been receiving."
ENTJ,"This occasional ruthlessness with personal relationships is They’ primary weakness, and if they aren’t careful they can develop quite the reputation. Sensing others’ feelings and emotions will never be a comfortable skill for They, but it is critical that they work consciously to develop it, both for their partners’ sake and for their own healthy emotional expression. If they don’t, they risk dominating and overruling their partners, and this insensitivity can easily break a relationship, especially early on."
ENTJ,"But as all goes well in the dating phase and a future is deemed viable, people with the XXXX personality type continue to impress with their creativity and energy. Their authentic confidence makes They’ sex life dynamic to say the least, and they often push to explore new ways to express their affection with imaginative enthusiasm. Yet They tend to have these innovations planned in advance, with some structure and predictability to their sex lives, leaving the true spontaneity to those less organized personality types."
ENTJ,"They are extremely growth-oriented, and will seize any opportunity to improve themselves, listening to and acting on criticisms, so long as they are logical ones, and always striving to improve their knowledge. At the same time, They expect this of their partners, and it is surprising to them that others don’t always share this attitude. Still more surprising to XXXX personalities is others’ active efforts to avoid these tense situations."
ENTJ,"They in particular would do well to remember that their approach is just one angle of a multi-faceted spectrum of alternatives. While They may view criticism as the most efficient route (and they’re often right), they should bear in mind that their partners may be more interested in emotional support and growth, an area of self-improvement that They themselves too often avoid."
ENTJ,"As with other Analyst types, They’ best matches are with other Intuitive (N) types, with one or two opposing traits to create more balance in the relationship. Mature They are able to recognize and adapt to the needs of their partners, and know that even the most rational individuals have emotional needs that must be met. Fortunately the same logic that dismisses emotions is also able to recognize that a conciliatory attitude can be the best tool to get the job done. With their strong senses of responsibility and dedication, people with the XXXX personality type are sure to make this effort, resulting in long-lasting, satisfying relationships."
ENTJ,"As in most aspects of their lives, in friendship They seek personal growth and inspiration, and they often have a plan for how to accomplish it. Friendships of circumstance, built on things like shared routines, are not They’ preferred method – rather, they pursue their friends, seek out individuals who share their passion for deep, meaningful discussions, and who enjoy learning and development as much as they do. It is not always easy to be They’ friends – they demand a lot from these relationships – but they pay a great deal of attention to their friendships, and it is unlikely that it will ever feel stagnant."
ENTJ,"XXXX friendships are built on ideas, and a lot of what they find enjoyable is the repartee of putting thoughts forward and defending them from assault from every angle. People with the XXXX personality type are very smart and highly critical, and they won’t back down if they are put on the defensive – in fact, there’s no better way to earn their respect."
ENTJ,"Only the most hardened rationalists are able to hold their ground against strongly expressed XXXX personalities, who neither need emotional support, nor understand others’ need for it. This lack of sensitivity is They’ chiefest weakness. Their tendency to challenge their friends, question their conclusions, and dismiss emotional arguments as irrelevant is especially difficult for Feeling-oriented friends to cope with. Either a point is supported by logic and reason, or it is erroneous."
ENTJ,"More enlightened They recognize that if ever there was an area where they could learn from others and improve themselves, it is in the realm of emotional sensitivity – to dismiss any aspect of personal growth borders on hypocrisy. Friendships with people from the Diplomat type group can be especially rewarding for They, as the shared Intuitive (N) trait fosters an instantaneous connection that can bridge the chasm between their uninhibited logic and the recognition that cooperation and conciliation can often accomplish more than that logic ever could alone."
ENTJ,"Still, the bulk of They’ friends will likely fall into the Analyst category, as all of these types share the same passion for logical, far-reaching ideas and critical debate. Anyone who can match They’ ability to brainstorm and theorize will find an honest and dedicated friend. Anyone who can’t or won’t, as with many more down-to-earth types who often question the point of such discussions, will find themselves ignored – perhaps a situation that is best for everyone."
ENTJ,"Often, given their strong will and critical nature, it is challenging enough to spend a great deal of time with They by choice, as in friendships and romance – to be with them by default, as in the parent-child relationship, can border on the impossible. This by no means suggests that people with the XXXX personality type are bad parents – far from it – simply that their relationships with children, who are typically more sensitive and less able to conduct truly rational analysis, require a great deal more emotional tact and personal liberty than they are accustomed to giving."
ENTJ,"But They are always up for a challenge, and will take their roles as parents seriously and with the utmost sense of personal responsibility. Holding themselves to a higher standard than most, XXXX personalities see the success of their children as a reflection of those personal standards, and want nothing more than to see them grow into smart, independent people who strive to achieve their goals. Establishing specific moral values is less important to They than the cultivation of the intellect and independent, rational thought."
ENTJ,"They welcome differences of opinion, and this is true with their children as well. But while gladly having rational, well-thought-out discussions about roles and responsibilities, at the end of the day They expect their authority to be respected. A disagreement is no excuse for shirking established responsibilities, and XXXX parents can be utterly uncompromising in maintaining this structure. This strictness can be a tremendous source of tension in the household – a little flexibility can go a long way."
ENTJ,"When these debates devolve into emotional appeals is when XXXX parents run into real trouble, as their persistent weakness with emotional tolerance makes dealing with growing children, especially adolescents, their most significant challenge. As in their other relationships, XXXX parents should strive to strengthen this skill – often enough young children don’t have the words to express their needs rationally, and adolescents don’t have the patience for it, a perfectly natural condition."
ENTJ,"XXXX parents should remember that a part of developing that necessary sense of independence is being able to control one’s own schedule and activities, to chart one’s own course, at least to a certain extent. People with the XXXX personality type will spare no effort for their children, but it’s sometimes the case that taking a deep breath and loosening their structures as their children grow and mature does more to achieve their goal of raising capable, intelligent adults than forced extracurriculars ever could."
ENTJ,"It is in the world of careers that They’ boldness and drive are truly at their best. No other personality type is better suited than They to be the respected leader of an organization or team, and no other personality type enjoys it quite so much. Combining their vision, intelligence and determination to push ideas through to completion no matter the obstacles, They are a force to be reckoned with."
ENTJ,"In the world of business, the sometimes overbearing level of self-confidence that They (especially Assertive ones) too often mishandle in their personal relationships is transformed into an admirable authority, keeping people on track and getting things done. Naturally the best careers for people with the XXXX personality type make the fullest use of these qualities, and many would describe executive positions and entrepreneurialism to be ideal lines of work – any position high enough that they can clearly see the horizon."
ENTJ,"Structure and order are key, and if someone gets sloppy, or holds things back with incompetence, laziness or inefficiency, They will not hesitate to come down, hard. XXXX personalities pursue their goals with singular vision, and have strict standards for themselves and others that are designed above all else to be effective. This makes They excellent corporate strategists, and their objectivity and clarity of thought make them respected lawyers and judges."
ENTJ,"None of this could work if no one could understand what They were thinking, and they have the good fortune of being clear and concise communicators, especially in person, making business administration a comfortable fit – so long as their tasks don’t stray too far into routine maintenance and upkeep. They also have a thirst for knowledge, and they aren’t afraid to use a principle once they’ve grasped its underlying mechanisms. Combining this with their leadership makes They trying, but effective, university professors."
ENTJ,"The only problem is, it takes time for They’ skills to be recognized, and stagnating as low-level employees will have them bouncing off the walls and deeply unhappy. People with the XXXX personality type crave leadership and responsibility, growth and opportunity, and genuinely enjoy managing others to get a job done. They are visionaries and leaders, not grunts or day-to-day administrators. Getting that to be recognized is not always easy, but They are probably up to the task."
ENTJ,"For people with the XXXX personality type, the workplace is all but a natural habitat. They’ efficiency and clear communication are valued, their leadership is admired, and their ability to simply get things done is unrivaled. That being said, some situations are more appropriate for They than others – these qualities all point to a managerial or executive role, making any position of comparative powerlessness highly undesirable."
ENTJ,"Subordinate positions are challenging for They, and it takes active management to ensure their satisfaction and engagement. Ever the high achievers, XXXX subordinates set out to learn new skills and to seek out new challenges and responsibilities, eager to prove that nothing is impossible with a little hard work. If things get a little slow, XXXX personalities may slip into periods of absentmindedness, but when they feel involved in the projects around them, they prove well organized and well prioritized."
ENTJ,"They hold themselves to very high standards, but a lot of what sets this tone is feedback from their environment – namely, criticism from their managers. Objective, rational statements about what is done right and what can be done better are helpful to They, and far from resenting such criticisms, they appreciate them. Opportunities for growth keep people with the XXXX personality type engaged and productive, and so long as their managers recognize this as their primary responsibility, it will be a fruitful and satisfying relationship."
ENTJ,"Among colleagues, They are sociable and greatly enjoy sharing ideas and critiques in their frequent brainstorming sessions. Natural leaders that they are, They tend to assert themselves into positions as representatives and project leads, considering their objectivity and charisma the perfect qualities for these roles. XXXX personalities enjoy working with equals, but people must demonstrate that they are equals – anyone They view as being less competent or driven will see only condescension and arrogance."
ENTJ,"They are strong-willed, even dominant, and though they enjoy inspiring and tutoring others, the energy they bring to the process can seem overbearing. When these roles are reversed, They’ mentors should bear in mind that their students are very rational and respect firm confidence – hand-holding, emotional appeals or wavering indecision will likely burn the bridge then and there. In a partnership, what is best is what is most effective, and time wasted sugarcoating reality is just that – time wasted."
ENTJ,"XXXX managers are confident, charismatic communicators, and they communicate but one vision: to get the job done as efficiently as possible, and to the highest standard of quality. All else is subordinate to that objective, but the means by which They achieve it cause others to adopt this cause as their own. They are natural leaders, and their ability to formulate a strategy and to identify the strengths of each member of their teams, incorporating those abilities into their plans so that each individual fills a unique and important role, makes them able motivators."
ENTJ,"But while these efforts boost morale and satisfaction among They’ likeminded subordinates, they are still crafted to achieve that ultimate goal of timely and exceptional work. Those seen as inefficient by their XXXX managers, or who demonstrate themselves to be lazy or to produce shoddy work will know in no uncertain terms of their failure to impress. The only way to recover is to comply, the only alternative is to find a new manager to impress, somewhere else."
ENTJ,"Armed with a powerful intellect and strategic thinking, They can overcome or outmaneuver obstacles that seem unbeatable to most. At the same time, their many quirks, such as often unconstrained rationalism, lead to many misunderstandings. Those misunderstandings end here. What you have read so far is just an introduction – we have a great deal more to tell you about the XXXX personality type."
ENTP,"XXXX (XXXX) is a person with the Extraverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Prospecting personality traits. They tend to be bold and creative, deconstructing and rebuilding ideas with great mental agility. They pursue their goals vigorously despite any resistance they might encounter."
ENTP,"No one loves the process of mental sparring more than the XXXX personality type, as it gives them a chance to exercise their effortlessly quick wit, broad accumulated knowledge base, and capacity for connecting disparate ideas to prove their points. They are the ultimate devil’s advocate, thriving on the process of shredding arguments and beliefs and letting the ribbons drift in the wind for all to see. They don’t always do this because they are trying to achieve some deeper purpose or strategic goal, though. Sometimes it’s for the simple reason that it’s fun."
ENTP,"Playing the devil’s advocate helps people with the XXXX personality type to not only develop a better sense of others’ reasoning, but a better understanding of opposing ideas – since They are the ones arguing them."
ENTP,"This tactic shouldn’t be confused with the sort of mutual understanding Diplomat personalities seek – They, like all Analyst personality types, are on a constant quest for knowledge, and what better way to gain it than to attack and defend an idea, from every angle, from every side?"
ENTP,"Taking a certain pleasure in being the underdog, They enjoy the mental exercise found in questioning the prevailing mode of thought, making them irreplaceable in reworking existing systems or shaking things up and pushing them in clever new directions. However, they’ll be miserable managing the day-to-day mechanics of actually implementing their suggestions. XXXX personalities love to brainstorm and think big, but they will avoid getting caught doing the “grunt work” at all costs. They only make up about three percent of the population, which is just right, as it lets them create original ideas, then step back to let more numerous and fastidious personalities handle the logistics of implementation and maintenance."
ENTP,"They’ capacity for debate can be a vexing one – while often appreciated when it’s called for, it can fall painfully flat when they step on others’ toes by say, openly questioning their boss in a meeting, or picking apart everything their significant other says. This is further complicated by They’ unyielding honesty, as this type doesn’t mince words and cares little about being seen as sensitive or compassionate. Likeminded types get along well enough with people with the XXXX personality type, but more sensitive types, and society in general, are often conflict-averse, preferring feelings, comfort, and even white lies over unpleasant truths and hard rationality."
ENTP,"This frustrates They, and they find that their quarrelsome fun burns many bridges, oftentimes inadvertently, as they plow through others’ thresholds for having their beliefs questioned and their feelings brushed aside. Treating others as they’d be treated, They have little tolerance for being coddled, and dislike when people beat around the bush, especially when asking a favor. XXXX personalities find themselves respected for their vision, confidence, knowledge, and keen sense of humor, but often struggle to utilize these qualities as the basis for deeper friendships and romantic relationships."
ENTP,"They have a longer road than most in harnessing their natural abilities – their intellectual independence and free-form vision are tremendously valuable when they’re in charge, or at least have the ear of someone who is, but getting there can take a level of follow-through that They struggle with."
ENTP,"Once they’ve secured such a position, They need to remember that for their ideas to come to fruition, they will always depend on others to assemble the pieces – if they’ve spent more time “winning” arguments than they have building consensus, many They will find they simply don’t have the support necessary to be successful. Playing devil’s advocate so well, people with this personality type may find that the most complex and rewarding intellectual challenge is to understand a more sentimental perspective, and to argue consideration and compromise alongside logic and progress.. Knowledgeable – They rarely pass up a good opportunity to learn something new, especially abstract concepts. This information isn’t usually absorbed for any planned purpose as with dedicated studying, people with the XXXX personality type just find it fascinating.. Quick Thinkers – They have tremendously flexible minds, and are able to shift from idea to idea without effort, drawing on their accumulated knowledge to prove their points, or their opponents’, as they see fit.. Original – Having little attachment to tradition, XXXX personalities are able to discard existing systems and methods and pull together disparate ideas from their extensive knowledge base, with a little raw creativity to hold them together, to formulate bold new ideas. If presented with chronic, systemic problems and given rein to solve them, They respond with unabashed glee.. Excellent Brainstormers – Nothing is quite as enjoyable to They as analyzing problems from every angle to find the best solutions. Combining their knowledge and originality to splay out every aspect of the subject at hand, rejecting without remorse options that don’t work and presenting ever more possibilities, They are irreplaceable in brainstorming sessions.. Charismatic – People with the XXXX personality type have a way with words and wit that others find intriguing. Their confidence, quick thought and ability to connect disparate ideas in novel ways create a style of communication that is charming, even entertaining, and informative at the same time.. Energetic – When given a chance to combine these traits to examine an interesting problem, They can be truly impressive in their enthusiasm and energy, having no qualms with putting in long days and nights to find a solution.. Very Argumentative – If there’s anything They enjoy, it’s the mental exercise of debating an idea, and nothing is sacred. More consensus-oriented personality types rarely appreciate the vigor with which XXXX personalities tear down their beliefs and methods, leading to a great deal of tension.. Insensitive – Being so rational, They often misjudge others feelings and push their debates well past others’ tolerance levels. People with this personality type don’t really consider emotional points to be valid in such debates either, which magnifies the issue tremendously.. Intolerant – Unless people are able to back up their ideas in a round of mental sparring, They are likely to dismiss not just the ideas but the people themselves. Either a suggestion can stand up to rational scrutiny or it’s not worth bothering with.. Can Find It Difficult to Focus – The same flexibility that allows They to come up with such original plans and ideas makes them readapt perfectly good ones far too often, or to even drop them entirely as the initial excitement wanes and newer thoughts come along. Boredom comes too easily for They, and fresh thoughts are the solution, though not always a helpful one.. Dislike Practical Matters – They are interested in what could be – malleable concepts like ideas and plans that can be adapted and debated. When it comes to hard details and day-to-day execution where creative flair isn’t just unnecessary but actually counter-productive, XXXX personalities lose interest, often with the consequence of their plans never seeing the light of day."
ENTP,"If there’s one thing They are good at, it’s coming up with a never-ending stream of innovations and ideas to keep things moving forward, and this is evident in their romantic relationships as well. For people with the XXXX personality type growth is key, and even before they’ve found a dating partner, they imagine all the ways that they can experience new things together, to grow in tandem. This can be an overwhelming process if their partner doesn’t match up, but when They find someone who shares their love of intellectual exploration, watch out."
ENTP,"From the earliest dates, They test their partners’ limits for this kind of potential, pushing boundaries and traditions, looking for open-mindedness and spontaneity. Dating XXXX personalities is hardly a boring experience, and they make use of their enthusiasm and creativity by delighting and surprising their partners with new ideas and experiences."
ENTP,"They’ idea of fun is often rooted in self-improvement, and people with this personality type bring their partners along the way, as much in a spirit of sharing as in a spirit of expectation. They see either growth or stagnation and don’t buy into the idea of a happy status quo, making them demanding as much as they are exciting."
ENTP,"Some may tire in the face of this constant improvement – while They’ vigor can be attractive, it can also wear down even the most patient partners. A little time to breathe and a chance to rest on one’s laurels for a moment is necessary for many people, but not something They are likely to appreciate. However, if their unwavering enthusiasm is met in kind, it can lead to a magnificent relationship characterized by its strength, depth, and spark."
ENTP,"This is perhaps most evident as They’ relationships progress into more intimate situations. All that exploratory curiosity and enthusiasm has a chance to be expressed in new ways when They and their partners come together, and they readily encourage their partners to try new things, to enjoy their intimacy without preconceived limitations."
ENTP,"For people with the XXXX personality type, this phase of their relationships is a chance to improve and develop in areas that are outside the realm of academia, though they approach it in much the same way – as a physical and intellectual process of striving towards excellence, rather than a spiritual or emotional expression of affection."
ENTP,"They’ desire to improve in this department makes them fantastic partners when the relationship reaches that point, but their attitude towards this process is also evidence of their most glaring shortcoming – their emotional obliviousness. While They are more open-minded than other Analyst personality types about others’ perspectives, they are also more likely to express their disdain for such things as emotional sensitivity in cuttingly well-phrased and clear terms, easily hurting their partners’ feelings without realizing it. XXXX personalities may even ignore their partners’ feelings altogether, instead immersing themselves entirely in some distant idea or opportunity, inaccessible."
ENTP,"They’ best compatibility rests with other Intuitive (N) types, with one or two opposing traits which help to create both balance and opportunities for growth. If they are with a more sensitive partner, this can be an excellent way for them to find another quality that they can work on together, making this weakness yet another opportunity to be creative, challenge themselves, and to deepen the attractiveness that this sense of progression brings to their relationships."
ENTP,"Loyalty, support, emotional feedback – these are not what They look for in their friendships. The last thing people with the XXXX personality type want to hear is “you’re right”, not unless they have absolutely earned the distinction in a heated round of intellectual debate. If they’re wrong, They want to be told so, and they want every detail of the faults in their logic to be laid bare, partly in their quest for oftentimes arbitrary truth, and partly just so they have to work to defend that logic with counterpoint and parry."
ENTP,"It’s often easy for They to test compatibility with a potential friend – they just need to test combatability. XXXX personalities are quick-witted, and their primary means of expressing this is in the form of arguments and discussions, where they will easily spend an entire evening debating an idea they may not even believe in."
ENTP,"These debates are never taken personally, no matter how heated they become or how striking the disagreement. Much as an athlete competes for the physical exertion and the spirit of competition itself, They debate for the sake intellectual stimulation and for the debate itself, and even in overwhelming victory or crushing defeat, it’s never about dominance, only inspiration to try harder next time."
ENTP,"They know how to relax and have fun too, it’s just that “fun” to They – a bottle of wine and a discussion about the causes of and solutions to the European migrant crisis – could be described as “an evening from hell” by many other personalities. But They are a genial and enthusiastic personality type for the most part, and pretty much any situation that allows for conversation and a little wordplay is an enjoyable outing."
ENTP,"They are actually remarkably good at communicating with friends and acquaintances of other personality types. Their natural tendency to argue as effectively as possible means that They are accustomed to communicating in other people’s language and frame of reference, and this translates well into normal conversation. Where people with the XXXX personality type do have difficulty relating to others is in emotional expression, the Achilles’ heel of all Analyst types."
ENTP,"Being inclined to suppress their emotions and feelings, when They are faced with a friend who, figuratively or literally, needs a shoulder to cry on, they have no clue how to handle the situation. They are perfectly willing and happy to offer a series of rational, reasonable solutions to the problem at hand, as They do for any situation where a problem needs to be fixed, but they are certainly not known for their sensitivity or outward affection, no matter how intuitively they may understand another’s position."
ENTP,"Worse is when XXXX personalities try to turn these emotional situations into something they find more comfortable: a debate. Given how remarkably good They are at arguing both sides of a point, they are remarkably bad at putting themselves in someone else’s shoes from an emotional standpoint. They should avoid at all costs the temptation to turn a discussion about the causes of a friend’s recent breakup into competitive intellectual fodder."
ENTP,"So long as everyone understands not to take their words too personally, anyone who isn’t afraid to discuss new ideas – and have them converted into so much confetti – is likely to find stimulating and thought-provoking friends in They. It’s not a compatibility that clicks with everyone, but They don’t really care about being liked by everyone anyways. As long as they get to alternate between being the sounding board and the megaphone, They and their friends are bound to enjoy each other’s company for a long, long time."
ENTP,"One might think that the blustery and flighty nature of They would make parenting a particular challenge for them, and in many ways, they’d be right. However, one thing people with the XXXX personality type love more than just about anything is a good challenge, a problem to fix, even if it comes to addressing their own weaknesses. They take their roles as parents seriously, and they are bound to be affected profoundly by this development in their lives – if anyone is able to take an outside influence, like their children, and use that influence to address their own faults, it is They."
ENTP,"From the beginning They’ distaste for rules and regulations is evident, and they are likely to give their young children the freedom necessary to explore on their own. Independence is one of They’ greatest needs, and they feel that no person is complete without an independent mind."
ENTP,"As their children grow and develop, They encourage them to think independently and voice objections, opinions and alternatives. But unlike Diplomat parents, who encourage their children to express their thoughts in terms of feelings and needs, They teach their children to approach these options from a position of impartiality and logic, to state what is more effective rather than what would make them feel good. As in other relationships, this quality of emotional inaccessibility is where They struggle."
ENTP,"As their children grow into adolescence and learn to find a balance in healthy emotional expression, people with the XXXX personality type may find themselves exasperated. While always up for a good debate on just about any subject, They often need their partners’ help in managing more emotional outbursts and arguments. They are more able than most, but even they have their limits and rules when it comes to vocal conflict."
ENTP,"Luckily, XXXX personalities recognize what’s at stake: they want their children to grow into smart, independent, honest adults. To convey those values, They know that they need, like with any other debate, to communicate in terms that are accessible to all sides. If that means learning how to use the tools of emotional expression and appeals, and in so doing becoming more emotionally expressive in real, personal terms as well, so be it."
ENTP,"In the world of careers, They have the benefit of being naturally engaged and interested in being productive and helpful. But rather than the sort of people-oriented helpfulness that Diplomat personality types bring to the table, XXXX personalities are focused on developing solutions to interesting and diverse technical and intellectual problems. They are a versatile personality type, and while it may take time for them to get to a point where they can fully utilize their skillset and qualities, they are likely to find that those qualities translate well into pretty much any career that so much as piques their interest."
ENTP,"Not every career allows this level of unbridled brainpower, but there are those that demand nothing but: entrepreneurship, engineering, even acting and photography. So long as They are honest with themselves about their strengths and weaknesses, they can thrive in most any career that is in need of a new line of thinking."
ENTP,"All this intellectual power can be intimidating, but unlike their Introverted (I) cousins, people with the XXXX personality type have the added benefit of being excellent communicators, in the written word but especially in face-to-face conversation. Though they dislike the constraints of managing others (and of being managed), this social adaptability allows They to be natural leaders, showing the way forward and inspiring others with sound logic and intellectual prowess. While others may object to these plans with emotional considerations or general resistance to change, things They place little value in, these competing comments are usually outmaneuvered by XXXX personalities’ deft arguments and subtly shifting goals."
ENTP,"The best careers reward intellectual competency and curiosity, allowing They to utilize their never-ending flow of ideas productively by affording a degree of spontaneity in how they engage their intellectual pursuits. People with the XXXX personality type value knowledge, rational thought and insight very highly, and they make brilliant lawyers, psychologists, systems analysts and scientists. It’s even possible for They to thrive as sales representatives, as they rationalize purchase decisions that may otherwise seem discretionary – so long as their managers know to give them the space they need to work their magic."
ENTP,"Really it all comes down to a sense of personal freedom, for They to know that they are allowed to apply themselves fully to understanding and solving the problems that interest them, without getting bogged down by social politics and trying to figure out what makes other people “tick”. Routine, structure and formal rules all feel like unnecessary hindrances to They, and they may find that their best careers yet allow them to engage their intellectual pursuits on their own terms, as freelance consultants or software engineers."
ENTP,"The key for They is to have the patience to get to a position that allows for these freedoms, to be in an environment long enough that not just their colleagues, but their managers and, in time, their subordinates, recognize what it is that they bring to the table. They have exceptional qualities – it’s quantifying their achievements and skills that presents the biggest challenge. But once they’ve got their foot in the door, once they’ve got a willing ear higher in the hierarchy, the sky’s the limit."
ENTP,"They have straightforward expectations in the workplace, but ones that aren’t always easy to meet. Strong believers in meritocracy, people with the XXXX personality type expect their ideas to be heard by those above them, expect robust debate among their peers, and demand that those they manage offer up new solutions and ideas regardless of their positions. While this isn’t always how things play out in reality, They know what to look for, and can avoid those strictly hierarchical institutions that they would otherwise struggle with."
ENTP,"This dynamic is clearest with XXXX subordinates, as they are comfortable challenging their managers’ ideas and have a strong (and well-expressed) dislike for restrictive rules and guidelines. They back this unorthodox behavior with their keen minds and curiosity, and are as capable of adopting new methods as they are of suggesting others do so. If something can be done better, it’s as simple as that, and XXXX personalities gladly take criticism, so long as it’s logical and performance-oriented."
ENTP,"The biggest challenge for XXXX subordinates is that it is often the fate of the “lower” positions to implement the details, do the dirty work and follow through on plans set out by their managers. This couldn’t be further from what They prefer to spend their time on – they can’t stand simple, routine work, and monotonous tasks are the stuff of nightmares. Things go over much better if managers are able to properly utilize They’ preference for tackling complex challenges and diverse projects."
ENTP,"It is as colleagues that They prove most polarizing, as their passions for brainstorming, debate and over-analysis drive more practical, task-oriented colleagues crazy, but serve as stimulating inspiration for those who appreciate the innovation They bring. Nothing bothers people with the XXXX personality type more than getting out of a meeting where everyone agreed with the first plan presented, only to hear everyone complain about how stupid the plan was ten minutes later – but they “didn’t want to make waves”. They strive for honest, direct and objective assessments of these ideas, so much so that they often earn reputations for their insensitivity and condescension."
ENTP,"Luckily They know how to relax too, and their witty wordplay, healthy sense of humor and outgoing nature win new friends quickly and easily. Always willing to draw on their repository of knowledge, conversations with XXXX personalities are informative and entertaining, which makes it easy for them to be the go-to person for tough problems that stump more rote approaches. Peer-to-peer relationships with They aren’t always easy, but it’s tough to argue that they don’t work."
ENTP,"While not always their goal, management is often where They are most at home, allowing them the freedom to fiddle with different approaches and come up with innovative ways to tackle new challenges without having to handle the tedious step-by-step implementation of these plans. They are open-minded and flexible managers, not just granting but also expecting the same freedom of thought that they themselves enjoy. This can lead to disorder, conflicting ideas and approaches being put forward, but They are also great at accurately and objectively assessing which plan is likely to be most effective."
ENTP,"This doesn’t always make friends, but being liked is less They’ goal than being respected and seen as intelligent and capable. And liked or no, people with this personality type hold firm ground in rational debates, making them fearsome advocates for their teams. The challenge for They is focus, as they may find themselves jumping from project to project in a quest for challenge and excitement before their teams are able to wrap up the details of their existing goals and obligations."
ENTP,"Armed with a powerful intellect and vivid imagination, They can overcome or outmaneuver obstacles that seem unbeatable to most. At the same time, their many quirks, such as often unconstrained rationalism, lead to many misunderstandings. Those misunderstandings end here. What you have read so far is just an introduction – we have a great deal more to tell you about the XXXX personality type."
INFJ,"An XXXX (XXXX) is someone with the Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Judging personality traits. They tend to approach life with deep thoughtfulness and imagination. Their inner vision, personal values, and a quiet, principled version of humanism guide them in all things."
INFJ,"The XXXX personality type is very rare, making up less than one percent of the population, but they nonetheless leave their mark on the world. They have an inborn sense of idealism and morality, but what sets them apart is that they are not idle dreamers. These individuals are capable of taking concrete steps to realize their goals and make a lasting positive impact."
INFJ,"People with this personality type tend to see helping others as their purpose in life. They can often be found engaging in rescue efforts and doing charity work. However, their real passion is to get to the heart of the issue so that people need not be rescued at all."
INFJ,"They indeed share a unique combination of traits. Though soft-spoken, they have very strong opinions and will fight tirelessly for an idea they believe in. They are decisive and strong-willed, but will rarely use that energy for personal gain."
INFJ,"They will act with creativity, imagination, conviction, and sensitivity not to create an advantage, but to create balance. Egalitarianism and karma are very attractive ideas to XXXX personalities. These types tend to believe that nothing would help the world so much as using love and compassion to soften the hearts of tyrants."
INFJ,"They find it easy to make connections with others. They have a talent for warm, sensitive language, speaking in human terms, rather than with pure logic and fact."
INFJ,"It makes sense that their friends and colleagues will come to think of them as quiet Extraverted personality types. However, they would all do well to remember that They need time alone to decompress and recharge, and not to become too alarmed when they suddenly withdraw. They take great care of others’ feelings, and they expect the favor to be returned – sometimes that means giving them the space they need for a few days."
INFJ,"Really, though, it is most important for people with the XXXX personality type to remember to take care of themselves. The passion of their convictions is perfectly capable of carrying them past their breaking point. If their zeal gets out of hand, they can find themselves exhausted, unhealthy, and stressed."
INFJ,"This becomes especially apparent when They find themselves up against conflict and criticism. Their sensitivity forces these personalities to do everything they can to evade these seemingly personal attacks. When the circumstances are unavoidable, however, they can fight back in highly irrational, unhelpful ways."
INFJ,"To They, the world is a place full of inequity – but it doesn’t have to be. No other personality type is better suited to create a movement to right a wrong, no matter how big or small. They just need to remember that while they’re busy taking care of the world, they need to take care of themselves, too.. Creative – Combining a vivid imagination with a strong sense of compassion, They use their creativity to resolve not technical challenges, but human ones. People with the XXXX personality type enjoy finding the perfect solution for someone they care about. This strength makes them excellent counselors and advisors.. Insightful – Seeing through dishonesty and disingenuous motives, They step past manipulation and sales tactics and into a more honest discussion. XXXX personalities see how people and events are connected. They are then able to use that insight to get to the heart of the matter.. Inspiring and Convincing – Speaking in human terms, not technical, They have a fluid, inspirational writing style that appeals to the inner idealist in their audience. They can even be astonishingly good orators, speaking with warmth and passion. This is especially true if they are proud of what they are speaking for.. Decisive – They’ creativity, insight, and inspiration are able to have a real impact on the world. This is because they are able to follow through on their ideas with conviction, willpower, and the planning necessary to see complex projects through to the end. People with the XXXX personality type don’t just see the way things ought to be; they act on those insights.. Determined and Passionate – When They come to believe that something is important, they pursue that goal with a conviction and energy that can catch others off-guard. They will rock the boat if they must. Not everyone likes to see this, but their passion for their chosen cause is an inseparable part of the XXXX personality.. Altruistic – These strengths are used for good. They will not engage in any actions or promote beliefs just to benefit themselves. They have strong beliefs and take the actions that they do because they are trying to advance an idea that they truly believe will make the world a better place."
INFJ,"Sensitive – When someone challenges or criticizes They’ principles or values, they are likely to receive an alarmingly strong response. People with the XXXX personality type are highly vulnerable to criticism and conflict. Questioning their motives is the quickest way to their bad side.. Extremely Private – They tend to present themselves as the culmination of an idea. This is partly because they believe in this idea, but also because They are extremely private when it comes to their personal lives. They use this image to keep themselves from having to truly open up, even to close friends. Trusting a new friend can be even more challenging for They.. Perfectionistic – XXXX personalities are all but defined by their pursuit of ideals. While this is a wonderful quality in many ways, an ideal situation is not always possible – in politics, in business, in romance. They, especially Turbulent ones, too often drop or ignore healthy and productive situations and relationships, always believing there might be a better option down the road.. Always Need to Have a Cause – XXXX personalities get so caught up in their pursuits that any of the cumbersome tasks that come between them and their ideal vision is deeply unwelcome. They like to know that they are taking concrete steps toward their goals. If routine tasks feel like they are getting in the way – or worse yet, there is no goal at all – they will feel restless and disappointed.. Can Burn Out Easily – Their passion, impatience for routine maintenance, idealism, and extreme privacy tend to leave They with few options for letting off steam. People with this personality type are likely to exhaust themselves in short order if they don’t find a way to balance their ideals with the realities of day-to-day living."
INFJ,"When it comes to romantic relationships, They take the process of finding a partner seriously. Not ones for casual encounters, people with the XXXX personality type instead look for depth and meaning in their relationships."
INFJ,"They will take the time necessary to find someone with whom they truly connect. Once they’ve found that someone, their relationships will reach a level of depth and sincerity of which most people can only dream."
INFJ,"Getting to that point can sometimes be a challenge for potential partners, especially if they are impatient types, as They are often perfectionistic and picky. People with this personality type aren’t easily talked into something they don’t want. If someone doesn’t pick up on that, they are unlikely to be forgiven, particularly in the early stages of dating."
INFJ,"Even worse is if their partner tries to resort to manipulation or lying, as They will see right through it. If there’s anything they have a poor tolerance for in a relationship, it is a lack of authenticity."
INFJ,"They will go out of their way to seek out people who share their desire for authenticity, and out of their way to avoid those who don’t, especially when looking for a partner. All that being said, people with the XXXX personality type often have the advantage of desirability. They are warm, friendly, caring, and insightful, seeing past facades and the obvious to understand others’ thoughts and emotions."
INFJ,"XXXX personalities are enthusiastic in their relationships. There is a sense of wisdom behind their spontaneity, allowing them to pleasantly surprise their partners again and again. These types aren’t afraid to show their love, and they feel it unconditionally."
INFJ,"They create a depth to their relationships that can hardly be described in conventional terms. Relationships with They are not for the uncommitted or the shallow."
INFJ,"When it comes to intimacy, They look for a connection that goes beyond the physical. They prefer to embrace the emotional and even spiritual connection they have with their partners. People with this personality type are passionate partners."
INFJ,"They see intimacy as a way to express their love and to make their partners happy. They cherish not just the act of being in a relationship, but what it means to become one with another person in mind, body, and soul."
INFJ,"There is a running theme with They, and that is a desire for authenticity and sincerity – in their activities, their romantic relationships, and their friendships. People with the XXXX personality type are unlikely to go for friendships of circumstance. They avoid situations like workplace social circles or chatting up their local baristas, where the only thing they really have in common is regular contact."
INFJ,"People with this personality type seek out others who share their passions, interests, and beliefs. They create friendships with people with whom they can explore philosophies and subjects that they believe are truly meaningful."
INFJ,"From the start, it can be a challenge to get to know They, as they are very private. XXXX personalities don’t readily share their thoughts and feelings, not unless they are comfortable and feel that those around them can be trusted. Since those thoughts and feelings are the basis for XXXX friendships, it can take time and patience to get to know them."
INFJ,"Meanwhile, They are very insightful and have a particular knack for seeing beyond others’ disguises. They are able to interpret others’ intentions quickly and easily and weed out those who they deem incompatible."
INFJ,"They are often perfectionistic, looking for ultimate compatibility. They also look for someone with whom they can grow and improve. Needless to say, this is a tall order, and They should try to remember that they are a particularly rare personality type. Even if they find someone compatible in that sense, the odds that they will also share every interest are slim."
INFJ,"They must learn to meet others halfway and recognize that the kind of self-improvement and depth they demand is simply exhausting for many types. Otherwise, they may end up abandoning healthy friendships in their infancy in search of more ideal compatibilities."
INFJ,"Further complicating things is They’ ability to passionately and clearly express themselves. These traits can lead to a lot of (unwanted) attention and popularity. Their quiet, determined idealism naturally draws influence. XXXX personalities, however, tend to avoid seeking power over others – and the people who are drawn to that type of power."
INFJ,"They will find themselves more sought after than they’d ever care to be. This makes it even more difficult for them to find someone with whom they truly have an affinity. Really, the only way to be counted among They’ true friends is to be authentic and to have that authenticity naturally reflect their own."
INFJ,"Once a common thread is found, though, people with the XXXX personality type make loyal and supportive companions. People with this personality type encourage growth and life-enriching experiences with warmth, excitement, and care."
INFJ,"Additionally, as trust grows, They will share more of what lies beneath the surface. If those ideas and motives are mutual, it’s the sort of friendship that will transcend time and distance, lasting a lifetime."
INFJ,"XXXX personalities don’t require a great deal of day-to-day attention. For them, quality trumps quantity every time. Over the years they will likely end up with just a few true friendships, built on a richness of mutual understanding that forges an enduring link between them."
INFJ,"As parents, They will tend to look at their relationships with their children as opportunities to learn and grow with someone they care about. They will also work to achieve another important goal – raising their children to be independent and all-around good people."
INFJ,"These types are devoted and loving toward their children throughout the parenting relationship. However, what They really look forward to is being able to communicate and relate to the people they helped to raise, as equals."
INFJ,"As their children grow, They will likely try to project a great deal of their own beliefs onto them. They will demand the same sort of integrity and honesty that they demand from themselves. They may even find themselves “guilting” their children into following their path in their weaker moments. Despite this, XXXX personalities will also push their children to think independently, make their own choices, and develop their own beliefs."
INFJ,"If all this independence is taken to heart, it can cause some trouble for XXXX parents as their children move into the more rebellious phase of adolescence. This is especially true if their children choose beliefs that go against what their XXXX parents hoped they would believe. In this case, They are likely to feel like their children are pointing out their flaws by following another path, a hurtful thing to such a sensitive personality type."
INFJ,"Ultimately, though, XXXX parents will realize that these conflicting beliefs aren’t a sign of their failure. Rather, they are a sign of their success in raising someone who learned to form their own ideals. As they grow, They’ children will also come to appreciate the combination of independence and integrity with which they were raised."
INFJ,"They strive to make sure that their children grow up with a firm understanding of the difference between right and wrong. Parents with this personality type encourage their children to fight for a cause they believe in, striving to be the best they can be. If they feel that they have accomplished this goal, XXXX parents will be satisfied with what they’ve accomplished together with their children."
INFJ,"They are likely to find that most corporate career paths are not designed for them, but for those focused on their status and material gain. However, people with this personality are able to find work that suits them in just about any field."
INFJ,"In fact, They are likely to face the opposite problem. Many struggle to begin a career early on because they see ten wildly different paths forward, each with its own set of rewards. This can be appealing but also heartbreaking, because picking just one means letting go of so much else."
INFJ,"XXXX personalities need to find meaning in their work and to know that they are helping and connecting with people. An XXXX working as a Ferrari salesperson, for example, is highly unlikely."
INFJ,"Their desire to help and connect makes careers in healthcare – especially the more holistic varieties – very rewarding for They. Roles as counselors, psychologists, doctors, life coaches, and spiritual guides are all attractive options."
INFJ,"They’ needs don’t end at meaning, though – any productive work can be meaningful, as any productive work helps someone, somewhere. XXXX personalities crave creativity, too. They strive to use their insight to connect events and situations, creating real change in others’ lives."
INFJ,"These needs are hard to meet in a corporate environment, where They will be forced to manage someone else’s policies alongside their own. For this reason, people with the XXXX personality type are more likely to find independence in a leadership position, or by simply creating their own business."
INFJ,"If they choose to go the independent route, they will focus on applying their personal touch, creativity, and altruism to everything they do. This can be the most rewarding option for XXXX personalities. When they step out of the overly humble supporting and noncompetitive roles they are often drawn to, they can move into positions where they can grow and make a difference."
INFJ,"They often pursue expressive careers such as writing, effective communicators that they are, and author many popular blogs, stories, and screenplays. Music, photography, design, and art are viable options too, and they all can focus on deeper themes of personal growth, morality, and spirituality."
INFJ,"Where They struggle is in work that doesn’t take personal needs into consideration, is overly repetitious, or promotes conflict. Jobs with these traits will leave XXXX personality types frustrated and unfulfilled. They can also struggle under the criticism and pressure that comes with jobs in corporate politics or sales."
INFJ,"XXXX personalities are clever and can do well in any of these fields. To be truly happy, however, they need to be able to work in a way that aligns with their values and allows them some independence. They need opportunities to learn and grow alongside the people they are helping and contribute to the well-being of humanity on a personal level."
INFJ,"They have pretty tall demands when it comes to a satisfying work environment. Not only do those with this personality type need to be able to express their creativity and insight, they also need to know that what they are doing has meaning."
INFJ,"People with this personality type need to know that their work helps people and promotes their own personal growth. Their work must be in line with their values, principles, and beliefs all the way."
INFJ,"Oftentimes, the best way for XXXX personalities to achieve this is not to have to answer to others’ rules at all. Instead, they should strive to be their own boss, neither above nor below anyone else, just directly interacting with the people and ideas that are important to them."
INFJ,"All that being said, They are a clever and inspired group. With a few of the right conditions, almost any position can be made to work for them."
INFJ,"As subordinates, They are likely to do poorly with strict rules, formal structures, and routine tasks. People with the XXXX personality type value cooperation and sensitivity. The more open-minded and personal their manager’s style is, and the more they feel their personal input is considered, the happier they’ll be."
INFJ,"They act on their convictions, so when they do something, it’s something that has meaning to them. If those actions come under criticism, especially the unwarranted kind, their morale is likely to tank spectacularly."
INFJ,"manager’s values need to be in line with the XXXX’s for both sides to work well together. Though usually idealistic, if their work environment does not line up with their values, people with the XXXX personality type can become angry and bitter. But if it’s a balance they can handle, with a little encouragement every now and then, They will work hard and thrive. People with this personality type are more than capable of handling tasks and workplace relationships."
INFJ,"As colleagues, XXXX personalities are likely to become quite popular. They are likely to be seen as positive, eloquent, and capable friends. Among their greatest strengths is the ability to identify others’ motives and defuse conflicts and tension before anyone else even senses a disturbance."
INFJ,"They are likely to place more importance on working together over efficiency, encouraging hard work, and helping others when needed. While this is usually a strength, there is a risk that others will take advantage of They’ desire to get things done. Coworkers may do this – on purpose or without realizing it – by shifting their tasks onto their more dedicated XXXX coworkers’ desks."
INFJ,"It should also be remembered that, at the end of the day, They are still Introverts, and this kind of popularity isn’t always welcome. They will need to step back and act the lone wolf from time to time, pursuing their own goals in their own ways. An unhealthy version of this tendency may pop up if They sense that their values are being compromised by a more ethically relaxed colleague."
INFJ,"As managers, They often dislike using their power. Individuals with this personality type prefer to see those who work under them as equals. They do this by focusing on coordinating tasks and supervising people, leaving the facts and details to others. They work hard to encourage others, not to crack the whip."
INFJ,"That’s not to say that people with the XXXX personality type have low standards – far from it. The They’ sense of equality means that they expect their subordinates to be as competent, motivated, and reliable as the They themselves."
INFJ,"XXXX managers are sensitive, understanding, and fair, able to appreciate individual styles and to make accurate judgments about others’ motivations. However, if an employee’s actions or attitude undermines an XXXX manager’s ethics or values, they will find little comfort in these qualities."
INFJ,"People with this personality type have no tolerance for lapses in reliability or morality. But, so long as no such lapse occurs, They will work tirelessly to ensure that their subordinates feel valued and happy."
INFJ,"Few personality types are as passionate and mysterious as They. As someone with this personality type, your imagination and empathy make you someone who cherishes their integrity and deeply held principles. Unlike many other idealistic types, however, you are also capable of turning those ideals into plans and executing them."
INFJ,"Yet They can be easily tripped up in areas where their idealism and determination are more of a liability than an asset. There are many areas in life where you may face challenges that, at times, can even make you question who you really are. Anything from navigating interpersonal conflicts, confronting unpleasant facts, pursuing self-realization, or finding a career path that aligns well with your inner core can cause internal frustration."
INFP,"XXXX (XXXX) is someone who possesses the Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Prospecting personality traits. Making up only 4% of the population, these rare personality types tend to be quiet, open-minded, imaginative, and apply a caring and creative approach to everything they do."
INFP,"XXXX personalities are true idealists, always looking for the hint of good in even the worst of people and events, searching for ways to make things better. While they may be perceived as calm, reserved, or even shy, They have an inner flame and passion that can truly shine. Comprising just 4% of the population, the risk of feeling misunderstood is unfortunately high for the XXXX personality type – but when they find like-minded people to spend their time with, the harmony they feel will be a fountain of joy and inspiration."
INFP,"Being a part of the Diplomat Role group, They are guided by their principles, rather than by logic (Analysts), excitement (Explorers), or practicality (Sentinels). When deciding how to move forward, they will look to honor, beauty, morality and virtue – They are led by the purity of their intent, not rewards and punishments. People who share the XXXX personality type are proud of this quality, and rightly so, but not everyone understands the drive behind these feelings, and it can lead to isolation."
INFP,"At their best, these qualities enable They to communicate deeply with others, easily speaking in metaphors and parables, and understanding and creating symbols to share their ideas. Fantasy worlds in particular fascinate They, more than any other personality type. The strength of their visionary communication style lends itself well to creative works, and it comes as no surprise that many famous They are poets, writers and actors. Understanding themselves and their place in the world is important to They, and they explore these ideas by projecting themselves into their work."
INFP,"They’ ability with language doesn’t stop with their native tongue, either – as with most people who share the Diplomat personality types, they are considered gifted when it comes to learning a second (or third!) language. Their gift for communication also lends itself well to They’ desire for harmony, a recurring theme with Diplomats, and helps them to move forward as they find their calling."
INFP,"Unlike their Extraverted cousins though, They will focus their attention on just a few people, a single worthy cause – spread too thinly, they’ll run out of energy, and even become dejected and overwhelmed by all the bad in the world that they can’t fix. This is a sad sight for They’ friends, who will come to depend on their rosy outlook."
INFP,"If they are not careful, They can lose themselves in their quest for good and neglect the day-to-day upkeep that life demands. They often drift into deep thought, enjoying contemplating the hypothetical and the philosophical more than any other personality type. Left unchecked, They may start to lose touch, withdrawing into “hermit mode”, and it can take a great deal of energy from their friends or partner to bring them back to the real world."
INFP,"Luckily, like the flowers in spring, XXXX’s affection, creativity, altruism and idealism will always come back, rewarding them and those they love perhaps not with logic and utility, but with a world view that inspires compassion, kindness and beauty wherever they go.. Idealistic – They’ friends and loved ones will come to admire and depend on them for their optimism. Their unshaken belief that all people are inherently good, perhaps simply misunderstood, lends itself to an incredibly resilient attitude in the face of hardship.. Seek and Value Harmony – People with the XXXX personality type have no interest in having power over others, and don’t much care for domineering attitudes at all. They prefer a more democratic approach, and work hard to ensure that every voice and perspective is heard.. Open-Minded and Flexible – A live-and-let-live attitude comes naturally to They, and they dislike being constrained by rules. They give the benefit of the doubt too, and so long as their principles and ideas are not being challenged, they’ll support others’ right to do what they think is right.. Very Creative – They combine their visionary nature with their open-mindedness to allow them to see things from unconventional perspectives. Being able to connect many far-flung dots into a single theme, it’s no wonder that many They are celebrated poets and authors.. Passionate and Energetic – When something captures They’ imagination and speaks to their beliefs, they go all in, dedicating their time, energy, thoughts and emotions to the project. Their shyness keeps them from the podium, but they are the first to lend a helping hand where it’s needed.. Dedicated and Hard-Working – While others focusing on the challenges of the moment may give up when the going gets tough, They (especially Assertive ones) have the benefit of their far-reaching vision to help them through. Knowing that what they are doing is meaningful gives people with this personality type a sense of purpose and even courage when it comes to accomplishing something they believe in."
INFP,"Too Idealistic – They often take their idealism too far, setting themselves up for disappointment as, again and again, evil things happen in the world. This is true on a personal level too, as They may not just idealize their partners, but idolize them, forgetting that no one is perfect.. Too Altruistic – They sometimes see themselves as selfish, but only because they want to give so much more than they are able to. This becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, as they try to push themselves to commit to a chosen cause or person, forgetting to take care of the needs of others in their lives, and especially themselves.. Impractical – When something captures They’ imagination, they can neglect practical matters like day-to-day maintenance and simple pleasures. Sometimes people with the XXXX personality type will take this asceticism so far as to neglect eating and drinking as they pursue their passion or cause.. Dislike Dealing With Data – They are often so focused on the big picture that they forget the forest is made of individual trees. They are in tune with emotions and morality, and when the facts and data contradict their ideals, it can be a real challenge for them.. Take Things Personally – They often take challenges and criticisms personally, rather than as inspiration to reassess their positions. Avoiding conflict as much as possible, They will put a great deal of time and energy into trying to align their principles and the criticisms into a middle ground that satisfies everybody.. Difficult to Get to Know – They are private, reserved and self-conscious. This makes them notoriously difficult to really get to know, and their need for these qualities contributes to the guilt they often feel for not giving more of themselves to those they care about."
INFP,"They are dreamy idealists, and in the pursuit of the perfect relationship, this quality shows strongest. Never short on imagination, They dream of the perfect relationship, forming an image of this pedestalled ideal that is their soul mate, playing and replaying scenarios in their heads of how things will be. This is a role that no person can hope to fill, and people with the XXXX personality type need to recognize that nobody’s perfect, and that relationships don’t just magically fall into place – they take compromise, understanding and effort."
INFP,"Fortunately these are qualities that They are known for, and while it can be a challenge to separate long-fostered fantasy from reality, They’ tendency to focus their attention on just a few people in their lives means that they will approach new relationships wholeheartedly, with a sense of inherent value, dedication and trust."
INFP,"But They aren’t necessarily in a rush to commit – they are, after all, Prospecting (P) types, and are almost always looking to either establish a new relationship or improve an existing one – they need to be sure they’ve found someone compatible. In dating, They will often start with a flurry of comparisons, exploring all the ways the current flame matches with the ideal they’ve imagined. This progression can be a challenge for a new partner, as not everyone is able to keep up with They’ rich imagination and moral standards – if incompatibilities and conflict over this initial rush mount, the relationship can end quickly, with They likely sighing that “it wasn’t meant to be.”"
INFP,"As a relationship takes hold, people with the XXXX personality type will show themselves to be passionate, hopeless romantics, while still respecting their partners’ independence. They take the time to understand those they care about, while at the same time helping them to learn, grow and change. While They are well-meaning, not everyone appreciates what can come across as constantly being told that they need to improve – or, put another way, that they’re not good enough. They would be aghast to find that their intents were interpreted this way, but it’s a real risk, and if their partner is as averse to conflict as They themselves, it can boil under the surface for some time before surfacing, too late to fix."
INFP,"This aversion to conflict, while contributing greatly to stability in the relationship when done right, is probably the most urgent quality for They to work on. Between their sensitivity and imagination, They are prone to internalizing even objective statements and facts, reading into them themes and exaggerated consequences, sometimes responding as though these comments are metaphors designed to threaten the very foundations of their principles. Naturally this is almost certainly an overreaction, and They should practice what they preach, and focus on improving their ability to respond to criticism with calm objectivity, rather than irrational accusations and weaponized guilt."
INFP,"But that’s at their uncommon worst – at their best, They do everything they can to be the ideal partner, staying true to themselves and encouraging their partners to do the same. They take their time in becoming physically intimate so that they can get to know their partners, using their creativity to understand their wants and needs, and adapt to them. People with this personality type are generous in their affection, with a clear preference for putting the pleasure of their partners first – it is in knowing that their partners are satisfied that They truly feel the most pleasure."
INFP,"The true friends of people with the XXXX personality type tend to be few and far between, but those that make the cut are often friends for life. The challenge is the many dualities that this type harbors when it comes to being sociable – They crave the depth of mutual human understanding, but tire easily in social situations; they are excellent at reading into others’ feelings and motivations, but are often unwilling to provide others the same insight into themselves – it’s as though They like the idea of human contact, but not the reality of social contact."
INFP,"In a lot of ways, this limits the potential pool of friends to other types in the Diplomat Role group, who are able to pick up on the subtle clues left by their XXXX friends, and who are more likely than not to enjoy something of a human enigma. A friendship with a Turbulent XXXX (XXXX-T) on the other hand, governed by social conventions and community participation as they are, would almost be a non-sequitur – though They may find the idea of being paired with their opposite fascinating enough to outweigh the practical challenges to such a friendship."
INFP,"To top it all off, ideas like networking and “the friend of my friend is my friend” hold little weight with They. Friendships are earned on their own merit, by dint of the intuitive respect They have for those with similar principles and values, rather than more practical alignments like those of coworkers. They’ tendency to protect their sensitive inner cores and values from criticism, especially if they are on the more turbulent side of the spectrum, means that acquaintances will likely get nowhere near them without sustained and tactful effort."
INFP,"But, if They’ shields are properly navigated and they decide to open up and trust another person, a strong, stable friendship will ensue, marked by passionate support and idealism, subtle poetic wit, and a level of emotional insight that is hard to match. They’ friends will be rewarded with calm, sensitivity and depth, and an ever-present desire to help, learn, and grow. But even the most confident and assertive They will only be able to keep up this relaxed and present exterior for so long."
INFP,"They will always need to disappear for a while, removing themselves from others so they can re-center on their own minds and feelings. Often enough people with the XXXX personality type will emerge from this time alone having come to some momentous decision that even their closest friends didn’t know was weighing on them, evading even the option of receiving the sort of support and advice they so readily give. Such is They’ way, for better or for worse."
INFP,"People who share the XXXX personality type share a tendency to not only strive to learn and grow as principled, moral individuals, but to bring likeminded people on that journey with them. In their own subtle, often shy way, They want to lead others forward, as kindred spirits – they will find no greater opportunity for this than in parenthood."
INFP,"From the start, XXXX parents are warm, loving and supportive, and take immeasurable joy in the wide-eyed wonder of their children as they explore, learn, and grow. People with the XXXX personality type will give their children the freedom they need to do this, keeping an open mind and letting their children gain their own sense of understanding. At the same time, XXXX parents will try to provide a backdrop to this freedom and experience, establishing a set of morals and values that guide that liberty with a sense of personal responsibility."
INFP,"However, this sense of responsibility has a harder side – if their children fall foul of their XXXX parents’ values, it will not be taken lightly. People with the XXXX personality type take their responsibilities in parenthood seriously, and in this measure above all others."
INFP,"In some ways, They’ tendency to hide their inner selves from view can be an advantage in parenting, as they are able to portray themselves as good role models on the outside, shielding their loved ones not just from their own occasional anger and depression, but from the broader evils in the world as well. This helps They to demonstrate outwardly the moral lessons they want their children to adopt, and at the same time to establish a sense of harmony in the household."
INFP,"The biggest challenge for XXXX parents, especially more Turbulent types who often have even more trouble with self-doubt than most, is to establish more practical and day-to-day structures and rules. They may be able to convey the abstract value of honesty with remarkable skill, but it’s not always easy to equate that idea with the practical reality of their children being home from the movies when they said they were going to be, and it’s especially challenging when these misunderstandings result in conflict. In these situations, XXXX personalities do best with a partner who is able to play a stronger hand in more administrative tasks than they can, so they can focus on the underlying spirit of those rules."
INFP,"It is perhaps more challenging for They to find a satisfying career than any other type. Though intelligent, the regimented learning style of most schools makes long years earning an advanced degree a formidable undertaking for people with the XXXX personality type – at the same time, that’s often what’s needed to advance in a field that rings true for them. They often wish that they could just be, doing what they love without the stress and rigor of professional life."
INFP,"Oftentimes, as with so many things, the answer lies somewhere in the middle, in a line of work that begins with passion and dedication, but which comes to require training so that the academia feels intimately linked to that passion. Too many They drift in frustration, ultimately succumbing to the necessities of day-to-day life in a job that wasn’t meant for them. But it turns out that, despite such exacting demands, modern economics places a premium on the very keys to They’ challenges: their creativity, independence, and need for meaningful relationships with individuals who need their help."
INFP,"First and foremost is seemingly every They’ dream growing up – to become an author. While a novel is a classic choice, it is rarely an accessible one, and there are many viable options for freedom-loving They. The internet brings to the world the opportunities of blogging and freelance work – as organizations expand their reach beyond their native tongues, they will come to depend on XXXX personality types, with their gift for language and written expression, to take their rougher translations and stale pitches and inject them with a sense of beauty and poetry. Smaller organizations will need more than ever to express with elegance the value they bring to local communities."
INFP,"The real beauty here is that it takes a core interest that people with the XXXX personality type share, while helping a cause they believe in, independently, through creative expression and personal growth, and makes it applicable to any interest there is. There will always be a need, and now more than ever, to win people’s hearts and minds with the written word."
INFP,"Some They will prefer a still more personal touch, being able to work face-to-face with clients, seeing that their personal effort really impacts another’s quality of life. Service careers such as massage therapy, physical rehabilitation, counselling, social work, psychology and even academic roles and retraining can be exceptionally rewarding for They, who take pride in the progress and growth they help to foster. People with the XXXX personality type have a tendency to put others’ interests ahead of their own, a mixed blessing by itself, but when a patient takes their first unaided step in the long road to recovery after an accident, nothing will feel more rewarding than that selflessness."
INFP,"Where They will not thrive is in a high-stress, team-heavy, busy environment that burdens them with bureaucracy and tedium. They need to be able to work with creativity and consideration – high-pressure salespeople they are not. It can be a challenge to avoid these roles, as they are the basis for so much starting work, and it’s often a risk to break away into something less dependable, but more rewarding. To find a career that resonates with They’ values though, that’s more than just a job, sometimes it’s just what needs to be done."
INFP,"In the workplace, They face the challenge of taking their work and their profession personally. To They, if it isn’t worth doing, it isn’t really worth doing, and this sense of moral purpose in their work colors everything from how they respond to authority to how they express it. Though the way the XXXX personality type shows through depends on the position, there are a few basic truths about what They seek in the workplace: they value harmony, need an emotional and moral connection to their work, and loathe bureaucratic tedium."
INFP,"As subordinates, They prefer latitude, and would much rather immerse themselves in a project, alone or with a close team, than simply be told what task to do and move on. People with the XXXX personality type aren’t looking for easy, forgettable work that pays the bills, they’re looking for meaningful work that they actually want to think about, and it helps for their managers to frame responsibilities in terms of emotional merit rather than cold rationalization or business for its own sake. They would rather know that their work will help to deliver a service they believe in than to know that the bottom line has been boosted by 3%."
INFP,"If these standards are met, managers will find an extremely dedicated and considerate employee in They. As idealistic opportunity-seekers They may not always work well in technical applications, where the facts and logic really matter and critique is often necessary, but they work beautifully in more human and creative endeavors. While some types, especially those in the Analyst Role group, respond favorably to negative feedback, taking criticism as an opportunity to not make the same mistake twice, people with the XXXX personality type would much rather hear what they did right and focus on what to do, rather than what not to."
INFP,"They feel most comfortable among colleagues – they aren’t interested in controlling others, and have a similar distaste for being controlled. Among their colleagues, They will feel freer to share their ideas, and while they may maintain some psychological distance, they will make every effort to be pleasant, friendly and supportive – so long as their coworkers reciprocate. They don’t like conflict or picking sides, and will do everything they can to maintain harmony and cooperation."
INFP,"Most of this comes down to good communication, which They prefer to conduct in person, for that personal touch, or in writing, where they can compose and perfect their statements. People with the XXXX personality type avoid using phones if they can, having the worst of both worlds, being both detached and uncomposed. They also like to feel like their conversations are meaningful, and while they enjoy exploring philosophy more than most, their patience for arbitrary hypothetical brainstorming or dense technical discussions is limited."
INFP,"As managers, They are among the least likely to seem like managers – their egalitarian attitudes lend respect to every subordinate, preferring communication as human beings than as a boss/employee opposition. People with the XXXX personality type are flexible, open-minded and give their subordinates the tools they need, be they responsible delegation or an intuitive and receptive sounding board, to get the job done. Keeping their eyes on the horizon, They set goals that achieve a desirable end, and help the people working under them to make that happen."
INFP,"There is a downside to this style, as sometimes the boss just needs to be the boss. They know how they feel about criticism, and are reluctant to subject others to that same experience, whether it’s needed or even welcome. Further complicating this role, when They are under stress, as when someone really does warrant criticism, they can become extremely emotional – they may not show it, but it can affect their judgment, or even cause them to withdraw inwards, in ways that can really hold back their team."
INFP,"Few personality types are as poetic and kind-hearted as They. Their altruism and vivid imagination allow They to overcome many challenging obstacles, more often than not brightening the lives of those around them. They’ creativity is invaluable in many areas, including their own personal growth."
ENFJ,"XXXX (XXXX) is a person with the Extraverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Judging personality traits. These warm, forthright types love helping others, and they tend to have strong ideas and values. They back their perspective with the creative energy to achieve their goals."
ENFJ,"They are natural-born leaders, full of passion and charisma. Forming around two percent of the population, they are oftentimes our politicians, our coaches and our teachers, reaching out and inspiring others to achieve and to do good in the world. With a natural confidence that begets influence, They take a great deal of pride and joy in guiding others to work together to improve themselves and their community."
ENFJ,"People are drawn to strong personalities, and They radiate authenticity, concern and altruism, unafraid to stand up and speak when they feel something needs to be said. They find it natural and easy to communicate with others, especially in person, and their Intuitive (N) trait helps people with the XXXX personality type to reach every mind, be it through facts and logic or raw emotion. They easily see people’s motivations and seemingly disconnected events, and are able to bring these ideas together and communicate them as a common goal with an eloquence that is nothing short of mesmerizing."
ENFJ,"The interest They have in others is genuine, almost to a fault – when they believe in someone, they can become too involved in the other person’s problems, place too much trust in them. Luckily, this trust tends to be a self-fulfilling prophecy, as They’ altruism and authenticity inspire those they care about to become better themselves. But if they aren’t careful, they can overextend their optimism, sometimes pushing others further than they’re ready or willing to go."
ENFJ,"They are vulnerable to another snare as well: they have a tremendous capacity for reflecting on and analyzing their own feelings, but if they get too caught up in another person’s plight, they can develop a sort of emotional hypochondria, seeing other people’s problems in themselves, trying to fix something in themselves that isn’t wrong. If they get to a point where they are held back by limitations someone else is experiencing, it can hinder They’ ability to see past the dilemma and be of any help at all. When this happens, it’s important for They to pull back and use that self-reflection to distinguish between what they really feel, and what is a separate issue that needs to be looked at from another perspective."
ENFJ,"People with the XXXX personality type are passionate altruists, sometimes even to a fault, and they are unlikely to be afraid to take the slings and arrows while standing up for the people and ideas they believe in. It is no wonder that many famous They are cultural or political icons – this personality type wants to lead the way to a brighter future, whether it’s by leading a nation to prosperity, or leading their little league softball team to a hard-fought victory.. Tolerant – They are true team players, and they recognize that that means listening to other peoples’ opinions, even when they contradict their own. They admit they don’t have all the answers, and are often receptive to dissent, so long as it remains constructive.. Reliable – The one thing that galls They the most is the idea of letting down a person or cause they believe in. If it’s possible, They can always be counted on to see it through.. Charismatic – Charm and popularity are qualities They have in spades. They instinctively know how to capture an audience, and pick up on mood and motivation in ways that allow them to communicate with reason, emotion, passion, restraint – whatever the situation calls for. Talented imitators, They are able to shift their tone and manner to reflect the needs of the audience, while still maintaining their own voice.. Altruistic – Uniting these qualities is They’ unyielding desire to do good in and for their communities, be it in their own home or the global stage. Warm and selfless, They genuinely believe that if they can just bring people together, they can do a world of good.. Natural Leaders – More than seeking authority themselves, They often end up in leadership roles at the request of others, cheered on by the many admirers of their strong personality and positive vision."
ENFJ,"Overly Idealistic – People with the XXXX personality type can be caught off guard as they find that, through circumstance or nature, or simple misunderstanding, people fight against them and defy the principles they’ve adopted, however well-intentioned they may be. They are more likely to feel pity for this opposition than anger, and can earn a reputation of naïveté.. Too Selfless – They can bury themselves in their hopeful promises, feeling others’ problems as their own and striving hard to meet their word. If they aren’t careful, they can spread themselves too thin, and be left unable to help anyone.. Too Sensitive – While receptive to criticism, seeing it as a tool for leading a better team, it’s easy for They to take it a little too much to heart. Their sensitivity to others means that They sometimes feel problems that aren’t their own and try to fix things they can’t fix, worrying if they are doing enough.. Fluctuating Self-Esteem – They define their self-esteem by whether they are able to live up to their ideals, and sometimes ask for criticism more out of insecurity than out of confidence, always wondering what they could do better. If they fail to meet a goal or to help someone they said they’d help, their self-confidence will undoubtedly plummet.. Struggle to Make Tough Decisions – If caught between a rock and a hard place, They can be stricken with paralysis, imagining all the consequences of their actions, especially if those consequences are humanitarian."
ENFJ,"People who share the XXXX personality type feel most at home when they are in a relationship, and few types are more eager to establish a loving commitment with their chosen partners. They take dating and relationships seriously, selecting partners with an eye towards the long haul, rather than the more casual approach that might be expected from some types in the Explorer Role group. There’s really no greater joy for They than to help along the goals of someone they care about, and the interweaving of lives that a committed relationship represents is the perfect opportunity to do just that."
ENFJ,"Their Intuitive (N) trait helps them to keep up with the rapidly shifting moods that are common early in relationships, but They will still rely on conversations about their mutual feelings, checking the pulse of the relationship by asking how things are, and if there’s anything else they can do. While this can help to keep conflict, which They abhor, to a minimum, they also risk being overbearing or needy – They should keep in mind that sometimes the only thing that’s wrong is being asked what’s wrong too often."
ENFJ,"They don’t need much to be happy, just to know that their partner is happy, and for their partner to express that happiness through visible affection. Making others’ goals come to fruition is often the chiefest concern of They, and they will spare no effort in helping their partner to live the dream. If they aren’t careful though, They’ quest for their partners’ satisfaction can leave them neglecting their own needs, and it’s important for them to remember to express those needs on occasion, especially early on."
ENFJ,"They’ tendency to avoid any kind of conflict, sometimes even sacrificing their own principles to keep the peace, can lead to long-term problems if these efforts never fully resolve the underlying issues that they mask. On the other hand, people with the XXXX personality type can sometimes be too preemptive in resolving their conflicts, asking for criticisms and suggestions in ways that convey neediness or insecurity. They invest their emotions wholly in their relationships, and are sometimes so eager to please that it actually undermines the relationship – this can lead to resentment, and even the failure of the relationship. When this happens, They experience strong senses of guilt and betrayal, as they see all their efforts slip away."
ENFJ,"If potential partners appreciate these qualities though, and make an effort themselves to look after the needs of their XXXX partners, they will enjoy long, happy, passionate relationships. They are known to be dependable lovers, perhaps more interested in routine and stability than spontaneity in their sex lives, but always dedicated to the selfless satisfaction of their partners. Ultimately, XXXX personality types believe that the only true happiness is mutual happiness, and that’s the stuff successful relationships are made of."
ENFJ,"When it comes to friendships, They are anything but passive. While some personality types may accept the circumstantial highs and lows of friendship, their feelings waxing and waning with the times, They will put active effort into maintaining these connections, viewing them as substantial and important, not something to let slip away through laziness or inattention."
ENFJ,"People with the XXXX personality type take genuine pleasure in getting to know other people, and have no trouble talking with people of all types and modes of thought. Even in disagreement, other perspectives are fascinating to They – though like most people, they connect best with individuals who share their principles and ideals, and types in Diplomat and Analyst Role groups are best able to explore They’ viewpoints with them, which are simply too idealistic for most. It is with these closest friends that They will truly open up, keeping their many other connections in a realm of lighthearted but genuine support and encouragement."
ENFJ,"Others truly value their XXXX friends, appreciating the warmth, kindness, and sincere optimism and cheer they bring to the table. They want to be the best friends possible, and it shows in how they work to find out not just the superficial interests of their friends, but their strengths, passions, hopes and dreams. Nothing makes They happier than to see the people they care about do well, and they are more than happy to take their own time and energy to help make it happen."
ENFJ,"While They enjoy lending this helping hand, other personality types may simply not have the energy or drive to keep up with it – creating further strain, people with the XXXX personality type can become offended if their efforts aren’t reciprocated when the opportunity arises. Ultimately, They’ give and take can become stifling to types who are more interested in the moment than the future, or who simply have Identities that rest firmly on the Assertive side, making them content with who they are and uninterested in the sort of self-improvement and goal-setting that They hold so dear."
ENFJ,"When this happens XXXX personalities can be critical, if they believe it necessary. While usually tactful and often helpful, if their friend is already annoyed by They’ attempts to push them forward, it can simply cause them to dig in their heels further. They should try to avoid taking this personally when it happens, and relax their inflexibility into an occasional “live and let live” attitude."
ENFJ,"Ultimately though, They will find that their excitement and unyielding optimism will yield them many satisfying relationships with people who appreciate and share their vision and authenticity. The joy They take in moving things forward means that there is always a sense of purpose behind their friendships, creating bonds that are not easily shaken."
ENFJ,"As natural leaders, They make excellent parents, striving to strike a balance between being encouraging and supportive friends to their children, while also working to instil strong values and a sense of personal responsibility. If there’s one strong trend with the XXXX personality type, it’s that they are a bedrock of empathetic support, not bullheadedly telling people what they ought to do, but helping them to explore their options and encouraging them to follow their hearts."
ENFJ,"XXXX parents take pride in nurturing and inspiring strong values, and they take care to ensure that the basis for these values comes from understanding, not blind obedience. Whatever their children need in order to learn and grow, XXXX parents give the time and energy necessary to provide it. While in their weaker moments they may succumb to more manipulative behavior, They mostly rely on their charm and idealism to make sure their children take these lessons to heart."
ENFJ,"Owing to their aversion to conflict, XXXX parents strive to ensure that their homes provide a safe and conflict-free environment. While they can deliver criticism, it’s not They’ strong suit, and laying down the occasionally necessary discipline won’t come naturally. But, people with the XXXX personality type have high standards for their children, encouraging them to be the best they can be, and when these confrontations do happen, they try to frame the lessons as archetypes, moral constants in life which they hope their children will embrace."
ENFJ,"As their children enter adolescence, they begin to truly make their own decisions, sometimes contrary to what their parents want – while They will do their best to meet this with grace and humor, they can feel hurt, and even unloved, in the face of this rebellion. They are sensitive, and if their child goes so far as to launch into criticisms, they may become truly upset, digging in their heels and locking horns."
ENFJ,"Luckily, these occasions will likely be rare. They’ intuition gives them a talent for understanding, and regardless of the heat of the moment, their children will move on, remembering the genuine warmth, care, love and encouragement they’ve always received from their XXXX parents. They grow up feeling the lessons that have been woven into the fabric of their character, and recognize that they are the better for their parents’ efforts."
ENFJ,"When it comes to finding a career, people with the XXXX personality type cast their eyes towards anything that lets them do what they love most – helping other people! Lucky for them, people like being helped, and are even willing to pay for it, which means that They are rarely wanting for inspiration and opportunity in their search for meaningful work."
ENFJ,"They take a genuine interest in other people, approaching them with warm sociability and a helpful earnestness that rarely goes unnoticed. Altruistic careers like social and religious work, teaching, counseling, and advising of all sorts are popular avenues, giving people with the XXXX personality type a chance to help others learn, grow, and become more independent. This attitude, alongside their social skills, emotional intelligence and tendency to be “that person who knows everybody”, can be adapted to quite a range of other careers as well, making They natural HR administrators, event coordinators, and politicians – anything that helps a community or organization to operate more smoothly."
ENFJ,"To top it all off, They are able to express themselves both creatively and honestly, allowing them to approach positions as sales representatives and advertising consultants from a certain idealistic perspective, intuitively picking up on the needs and wants of their customers, and working to make them happier. However, They need to make sure they get to focus on people, not systems and spreadsheets, and they are unlikely to have the stomach for making the sort of decisions required in corporate governance positions – they will feel haunted, knowing that their decision cost someone their job, or that their product cost someone their life."
ENFJ,"Having a preference for Intuitive (N) trait over its Observant (S) counterpart also means that careers demanding exceptional situational awareness, such as law enforcement, military service, and emergency response, will cause They to burn out quickly. While great at organizing willing parties and winning over skeptics, in dangerous situations They just won’t be able to maintain the sort of focus on their immediate physical surroundings that they inevitably demand of themselves hour after hour, day after day."
ENFJ,"It makes a great deal more sense for They to be the force keeping these vital services organized and running well, taking their long-term views, people skills and idealism, and using them to shape the situation on the ground, while more physical personality types manage the moment-to-moment crises. People with the XXXX personality type are always up for a good challenge – and nothing thrills them quite like helping others. But while willing to train the necessary skills, They will always show an underlying preference for the sort of help that draws a positive long-term trend, that effects change that really sticks."
ENFJ,"Careers operating behind enemy lines and arriving at the scene of the crime too late to help will simply weigh on They’ sensitive hearts and minds, especially if criticized despite their efforts. On the other hand, They are a driven, versatile group, and that same vision that pulls them towards administration and politics can help them focus through the stress of the moment, knowing that each second of effort contributes to something bigger than themselves."
ENFJ,"People with the XXXX personality type are intelligent, warm, idealistic, charismatic, creative, social... With this wind at their backs, They are able to thrive in many diverse roles, at any level of seniority. Moreover, they are simply likeable people, and this quality propels them to success wherever they have a chance to work with others."
ENFJ,"As subordinates, They will often underestimate themselves – nevertheless, they quickly make an impression on their managers. Quick learners and excellent multitaskers, people with the XXXX personality type are able to take on multiple responsibilities with competence and good cheer. They are hardworking, reliable and eager to help – but this can all be a double-edged sword, as some managers will take advantage of They’ excellent quality of character by making too many requests and overburdening their XXXX subordinates with extra work. They are conflict-averse and try to avoid unnecessary criticism, and in all likelihood will accept these extra tasks in an attempt to maintain a positive impression and frictionless environment."
ENFJ,"As colleagues, They’ desire to assist and cooperate is even more evident as they draw their coworkers into teams where everyone can feel comfortable expressing their opinions and suggestions, working together to develop win-win situations that get the job done. They’ tolerance, open-mindedness and easy sociability make it easy for them to relate to their colleagues, but also make it perhaps a little too easy for their colleagues to shift their problems onto They’ plates. People with the XXXX personality type are sensitive to the needs of others, and their role as a social nexus means that problems inevitably find their way to They’ doorsteps, where colleagues will find a willing, if overburdened, associate."
ENFJ,"While perfectly capable as subordinates and colleagues, They’ true calling, where their capacity for insightful and inspiring communication and sensitivity to the needs of others really shows, is in managing teams. As managers, They combine their skill in recognizing individual motivations with their natural charisma to not only push their teams and projects forward, but to make their teams want to push forward. They may sometimes stoop to manipulation, the alternative often being a more direct confrontation, but They’ end goal is always to get done what they set out to do in a way that leaves everyone involved satisfied with their roles and the results they achieved together."
ENFJ,"Few personality types are as inspiring and charismatic as They. Their idealism and vision allow They to overcome many challenging obstacles, more often than not brightening the lives of those around them. They’ imagination is invaluable in many areas, including their own personal growth."
ENFP,"XXXX (XXXX) is someone with the Extraverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Prospecting personality traits. These people tend to embrace big ideas and actions that reflect their sense of hope and goodwill toward others. Their vibrant energy can flow in many directions."
ENFP,"The XXXX personality is a true free spirit. They are often the life of the party, but unlike types in the Explorer Role group, They are less interested in the sheer excitement and pleasure of the moment than they are in enjoying the social and emotional connections they make with others. Charming, independent, energetic and compassionate, the 7% of the population that they comprise can certainly be felt in any crowd."
ENFP,"More than just sociable people-pleasers though, They, like all their Diplomat cousins, are shaped by their Intuitive (N) quality, allowing them to read between the lines with curiosity and energy. They tend to see life as a big, complex puzzle where everything is connected – but unlike Analyst personality types, who tend to see that puzzle as a series of systemic machinations, They see it through a prism of emotion, compassion and mysticism, and are always looking for a deeper meaning."
ENFP,"Many other types are likely to find these qualities irresistible, and if they’ve found a cause that sparks their imagination, They will bring an energy that oftentimes thrusts them into the spotlight, held up by their peers as a leader and a guru – but this isn’t always where independence-loving They want to be. Worse still if they find themselves beset by the administrative tasks and routine maintenance that can accompany a leadership position. They’ self-esteem is dependent on their ability to come up with original solutions, and they need to know that they have the freedom to be innovative – they can quickly lose patience or become dejected if they get trapped in a boring role."
ENFP,"Luckily, They know how to relax, and they are perfectly capable of switching from a passionate, driven idealist in the workplace to that imaginative and enthusiastic free spirit on the dance floor, often with a suddenness that can surprise even their closest friends. Being in the mix also gives them a chance to connect emotionally with others, giving them cherished insight into what motivates their friends and colleagues. They believe that everyone should take the time to recognize and express their feelings, and their empathy and sociability make that a natural conversation topic."
ENFP,"The XXXX personality type needs to be careful, however – if they rely too much on their intuition, assume or anticipate too much about a friend’s motivations, they can misread the signals and frustrate plans that a more straightforward approach would have made simple. This kind of social stress is the bugbear that keeps harmony-focused Diplomats awake at night. They are very emotional and sensitive, and when they step on someone’s toes, they both feel it."
ENFP,"They will spend a lot of time exploring social relationships, feelings and ideas before they find something that really rings true. But when they finally do find their place in the world, their imagination, empathy and courage are likely to produce incredible results.. Curious – When it comes to new ideas, They aren’t interested in brooding – they want to go out and experience things, and don’t hesitate to step out of their comfort zones to do so. They are imaginative and open-minded, seeing all things as part of a big, mysterious puzzle called life.. Observant – They believe that there are no irrelevant actions, that every shift in sentiment, every move and every idea is part of something bigger. To satisfy their curiosity, They try to notice all of these things, and to never miss a moment.. Energetic and Enthusiastic – As they observe, forming new connections and ideas, They won’t hold their tongues – they’re excited about their findings, and share them with anyone who’ll listen. This infectious enthusiasm has the dual benefit of giving They a chance to make more social connections, and of giving them a new source of information and experience, as they fit their new friends’ opinions into their existing ideas.. Excellent Communicators – It’s a good thing that They have such strong people skills, or they’d never express these ideas. They enjoy both small talk and deep, meaningful conversations, which are just two sides of the same coin for them, and are adept at steering conversations towards their desired subjects in ways that feel completely natural and unforced.. Know How to Relax – It’s not all “nature of the cosmos” discussions with They – people with this personality type know that sometimes, nothing is as important as simply having fun and experiencing life’s joys. That Intuitive trait lets They know that it’s time to shake things up, and these wild bursts of enthusiastic energy can surprise even their closest friends.. Very Popular and Friendly – All this adaptability and spontaneity comes together to form a person who is approachable, interesting and exciting, with a cooperative and altruistic spirit and friendly, empathetic disposition. They get along with pretty much everyone, and their circles of friends stretch far and wide."
ENFP,"Poor Practical Skills – When it comes to conceiving ideas and starting projects, especially involving other people, They have exceptional talent. Unfortunately their skill with upkeep, administration, and follow-through on those projects struggles. Without more hands-on people to help push day-to-day things along, They’ ideas are likely to remain just that – ideas.. Find it Difficult to Focus – They are natural explorers of interpersonal connections and philosophy, but this backfires when what needs to be done is that XXXX report sitting right in front of them. It’s hard for They to maintain interest as tasks drift towards routine, administrative matters, and away from broader concepts.. Overthink Things – They don’t take things at face value – they look for underlying motives in even the simplest things. It’s not uncommon for They to lose a bit of sleep asking themselves why someone did what they did, what it might mean, and what to do about it.. Get Stressed Easily – All this overthinking isn’t just for their own benefit – They, especially Turbulent ones, are very sensitive, and care deeply about others’ feelings. A consequence of their popularity is that others often look to them for guidance and help, which takes time, and it’s easy to see why They sometimes get overwhelmed, especially when they can’t say yes to every request.. Highly Emotional – While emotional expression is healthy and natural, with They even viewing it as a core part of their identity, it can come out strongly enough to cause problems for this personality type. Particularly when under stress, criticism or conflict, They can experience emotional bursts that are counter-productive at best.. Independent to a Fault – They loathe being micromanaged and restrained by heavy-handed rules – they want to be seen as highly independent masters of their own fates, even possessors of an altruistic wisdom that goes beyond draconian law. The challenge for They is that they live in a world of checks and balances, a pill they are not happy to swallow."
ENFP,"When it comes to relationships, there’s hardly anyone around who is more excited than They to share with their partners the bounty of ideas and eye-opening experiences that life has to offer. For people with the XXXX personality type, relationships are a joyous process of mutual exploration and imagination, a chance to connect with another soul. They take their relationships seriously, and are known for their uninhibited and unshakeable devotion to the people to whom they’ve committed their hearts."
ENFP,"In the dating phase, if They can be said to tolerate such a formal process to begin with, they will show these qualities by showering their new flames with affection, and will do everything they can to build a strong relationship by demonstrating their devotion and reliability by whatever means available."
ENFP,"Long-distance relationships are quite common among They, as they view physical distance as just another idea, no match for concepts like love. This gives them the chance to demonstrate their commitment, both by staying true despite the physical separation, and with overtures of effort to surprise their partners, crossing that distance on a whim. These are demonstrations of They’ mystery, idealism and deep emotion, and such efforts often keep the flames of a relationship burning bright."
ENFP,"People with the XXXX personality type express these ideals sexually as well, exploring the physical with imagination and passion, viewing these times together as a chance to let their feelings for each other shine, sharing their love and affection. They will willingly experiment with their partners, even early in a relationship, but they can also be oddly perfectionistic, believing that these physical acts are a representation of their deeper love, and as such should not be performed carelessly. This perfectionism is also a reflection of their sensitivity, their desire to not disappoint, and They appreciate a well-placed compliment."
ENFP,"Not everyone can handle the excitement, occasional neediness, and emotional ups and downs that this philosophy entails, whether long-distance or long-term, mystical or physical. They constantly explore new ideas and improvements, fantasize about future possibilities – in dating, this tendency to look at potential rather than the present can be self-defeating, and their spontaneity makes it harder to stay focused on their end goal of a long-term relationship. If their partners aren’t able to reciprocate these acts of excitement and devotion, They will likely end up feeling unhappy and misunderstood."
ENFP,"They go all-in with their relationships, and if they fall apart despite their efforts, they can end up plagued with questions about why the relationship failed and what they could have done differently – without a buoy, these thoughts can crush They’ self-esteem as they sink into depression. It’s important for XXXX personalities, as with anyone, to remember that relationships are in all ways mutual – mutual interest, mutual growth, and mutual responsibility – and they can’t be solely accountable."
ENFP,"After a trial like this, They may be reluctant to open up and commit, and it can take years for a partner to navigate their bewildering depth and intensity, falsely believing that They’ enthusiasm and apparent openness means that they wear everything on their sleeves. The reality is that They’ spontaneity, the seeming inconsistency and erraticism the untrained eye sees, isn’t a product of flightiness or lack of depth, but the opposite – it is a drive to express ideas about a mystical, all-encompassing energy, in the confines of a physical world, and underlying it all is the uniting principle of love, expressed in many different ways, but unshakeable and infinite at its core."
ENFP,"As friends, They are cheerful and supportive, always sharing and developing ideas, and staying open-minded, taking in others’ thoughts and feelings. This warmth and sincerity makes people with the XXXX personality type masters of drawing people out of their shells, and as a result they tend to have a huge circle of friends."
ENFP,"More outgoing types will naturally gravitate towards them, but They will also go to great lengths and be surprisingly persistent in their efforts to get to know more reserved personalities. Their ability to tune into others and speak their language with that characteristic infectious enthusiasm helps them in this endeavor, and the allure of mystery that reserved types, especially Introverted Intuitives, bring to the table will keep They intrigued for years. These personality types may never be able to reciprocate the breadth of human interest that They present, but they do appreciate They’ efforts."
ENFP,"But They’ interest in others can be a double-edged sword – this pure idealism comes with certain expectations, and too often They hold their friends in an unrealistic light, expecting them to keep up with the constant flow of ideas and experiences that they consider integral to life. They put their whole hearts into their friendships, and it can come as a shock for them to find that their friends aren’t the flawless Titans that they believed them to be. Whether it’s simple social fatigue or a focus on the physical and the practical instead of the mystical, people with the XXXX personality type can find themselves disappointed by what they see as a lack of substance beneath the surface."
ENFP,"They tend to get deeply involved in others’ lives, going to great lengths and efforts to be the selfless, caring and supportive people they are, and all the while forget to take care of themselves. Both in terms of basic needs like financial stability and rest, as well as more emotional needs like mutual understanding and reciprocation, XXXX personalities tend to give much more of themselves than most are even capable of giving back. This sort of imbalance isn’t sustainable, as (seemingly) one-sided generosity often leads to criticism and resentment on both sides."
ENFP,"Luckily, They are open-minded and sincere enough in their friendships, and connect with and understand even their acquaintances well enough, that they recognize that not everyone expresses themselves in the same ways, and that that’s okay. Their sensitivity may make it too challenging to play with more critical and argumentative personalities, such as strongly expressed Thinking (T) and Judging (J) types, but they do appreciate, even cherish, the company of most anyone who appreciates theirs, and the adventures and experiences they have together are the stuff a good life is made of."
ENFP,"If there is anything that makes They great parents, it’s the sense of wonder they have for all things new and beautiful, a sense that they will be able to share with their children every day as they learn and grow. Throughout their children’s lives, They provide a combination of almost overwhelming love and support, and an unstructured environment revolving around freedom and creativity. This in no way means that people with the XXXX personality type will simply leave their children to their own devices without guidance – rather, XXXX parents want to share in their children’s perspective, share in a world without bounds."
ENFP,"XXXX parents are playful and warm, and love to see their children excited, playing in and experimenting with the world around them. It is likely that XXXX parents will encourage this play and growth by suggesting activities and lessons."
ENFP,"While they often enough recognize the value of structure and predictability, XXXX parents are unlikely to have the heart (or as they may see it, the lack of heart) to establish these limitations themselves. They may need to depend on their partners to provide some necessary guidelines and discipline from time to time, but XXXX parents will always have the advantage of their open-minded and empathetic nature, making them not just parents, but friends who their children feel comfortable confiding in. They needn’t always depend on their children broaching the subject either, as They have a natural skill in spotting emotional disharmony or physical discomfort in others."
ENFP,"As their children approach the teenage years, all this emotion and attention can start to cloy, and their children may seek a more private independence. This can be a challenge for people with the XXXX personality type – they have strong emotions, and invest those emotions heavily in the things and people they care about. While they may not be big on using proven ideas, They do like to see whether or not their ideas work, and this applies to their thoughts on parenting, too. As their adolescent children withdraw, they leave an unsolved mystery that can last for years, leaving their XXXX parents wondering if their ideas on raising their children actually work, actually result in happy, independent and creative adults."
ENFP,"Luckily for them, so long as they raise their children with a sense of productive independence, rather than an aimless, against-the-grain antipathy, They will find that their children have developed a strong sense of self and self-worth, going confidently out into the big, wide world at their own pace and in their own style, knowing that they have both themselves and their XXXX parents to depend on."
ENFP,"“Can’t I fly helicopters AND be an oceanographer who writes songs and cooks?” It’s a big world out there – perhaps even a little too big. They are fascinated by new ideas, both in terms of developments in fields they are already familiar with, and when new subjects come along. The trick for people with the XXXX personality type is to take advantage of this quality, this wonder with the magnificent breadth and detail in the world, and to use it to propel themselves further and deeper than others are willing or able to go."
ENFP,"Chief among They’ talents is their people skills, a quality that is even more valuable now than ever. Even in traditional Analyst strongholds like engineering, systems analysis and the sciences, They’ ability to network and match the communication styles of their audience means that even as they explore new challenges on their own, they will be able to work with others, explore others’ perspectives and glean new insights into their projects. Much of modern progress stems from incorporating other studies into typically disassociated fields, and no one is better equipped to merge broad interests than talented, energetic and future-minded They."
ENFP,"And while Thinking types may be better at applying logic to systems and machines, people with the XXXX personality type are able to apply that same logic to human interactions and networks, using their exceptional social perception to find out what makes people tick. This lends They a solid foothold in any human science or service, from psychology, counseling and teaching to politics, diplomacy and detective work. All of these fields have another important similarity: they are in constant development, shifting, presenting new angles and new approaches. It’s simply not possible to be good in these fields and content with the way things are, and this is where They truly shine."
ENFP,"Where They do not shine is in systems of strict regimentation and hierarchy, such as military service. They thrive on the ability to question the status quo and explore the alternatives, and if this is a quality that is not just unappreciated but actually frowned upon, this will not only make them unhappy, but it may even threaten their emotional stability. Repetition, predictability, boredom… while some Sentinel types may appreciate predictability and clear hierarchies, these are not selling points for They. People with the XXXX personality type need to feel like they’re pushing boundaries and exploring ideas, and should focus on interests and careers that encourage that."
ENFP,"Many more career options satisfy these needs, and not just the scientific ones – writing, journalism, acting and TV reporting all give They a chance to explore something new every day and stir the pot a little while they’re at it. It may come to pass though, that the best way forward for XXXX personalities is to establish themselves as entrepreneurs and consultants, blazing their own trails and taking on whatever project is most fascinating. So long as they get to use their people skills, identify and achieve their own goals and inspire their colleagues and followers, They will be happy."
ENFP,"There are two basic things that They seek most in the workplace: The chance to explore new ideas, and the chance to conduct that exploration alongside other people who share their excitement. These qualities show through at all levels of hierarchy, though much like other Diplomat personality types, They would prefer that there be hardly a hierarchy at all. People with the XXXX personality type possess warmth, creativity, and an open-mindedness that makes them excellent listeners. If these qualities are recognized by their employers, they will always be able to count on their XXXX employees to innovate and boost morale."
ENFP,"They are growth-oriented, and as subordinates they’ll impress their managers with their creativity and adaptability. People with the XXXX personality type are excellent listeners, able to analyze and understand others’ perspectives effortlessly. It’s perhaps this quality that most makes They intolerant of micromanagement – the way they see it, they understand what’s been asked of them, and all they require is the freedom to accomplish their task. If this need isn’t met, managers may find a quickly stressed XXXX subordinate."
ENFP,"To a certain extent though, some direct management is often necessary, as They are notorious for letting their attention slip from one project to the next before they’ve dotted their I’s and crossed their T’s. They love exploring new ideas and learning new things, and once something becomes familiar, its allure starts to fade. But, if managers are able to maintain a spirit of guidance and camaraderie instead of 'bossiness', they will find loyal and devoted contributors in their XXXX subordinates."
ENFP,"They are people-people, and as far as the workplace is concerned, this quality shows through best among colleagues. More than just coworkers, They view their colleagues as friends, people who they take a genuine interest in, providing support and cheer when they’re down or stressed. People with the XXXX personality type are warm and optimistic, always searching for and usually finding win-win situations for everyone."
ENFP,"Brainstorms among equals are They’ forte, and they listen to different viewpoints and suggestions not just with tolerance, but genuine excitement. Their ability to relax and have fun will always make them popular around the water cooler, but what sets They apart is that they can transition that popularity into natural leadership, instinctively picking up on colleagues’ motivations and pulling their teams together, pushing them forward towards whatever truth they’ve been tasked to find."
ENFP,"They are not great fans of heavy hierarchy and bureaucracy, and this is most evident when they take on the role of manager. As managers, XXXX personalities behave much like they do as colleagues – they establish real friendships, and use their broad popularity to inspire and motivate, taking on the role of leader, working alongside their subordinates, rather than shouting from behind their desks. They will tend to believe in the concept of intrinsic motivation, the idea that things are worth doing for their own sake, not because of some convoluted system of punishments and rewards."
ENFP,"Unfortunately, not everyone buys into this philosophy – challenges arise when faced with subordinates who actually prefer to be closely directed, with clearly defined objectives and timetables, people who are just doing their jobs. More challenging still are those rare moments when a reprimand is simply necessary – while They prefer to meet dissent with an open ear, and to use their excellent capacity for sensing mood and morale to preempt such an act to begin with, sometimes the carrot and the stick are necessary, and using them is the biggest challenge for the XXXX personality type. But They’ capacity for adjusting their communication to most any style will always shine through, helping to smooth things over and adapt to the needs of their team."
ENFP,"Few personality types are as creative and charismatic as They. Known for their idealism and enthusiasm, They are good at dealing with unexpected challenges and brightening the lives of those around them. They’ imagination is invaluable in many areas, including their own personal growth."
ISTJ,"XXXX (XXXX) is someone with the Introverted, Observant, Thinking, and Judging personality traits. These people tend to be reserved yet willful, with a rational outlook on life. They compose their actions carefully and carry them out with methodical purpose."
ISTJ,"The XXXX personality type is thought to be the most abundant, making up around 13% of the population. Their defining characteristics of integrity, practical logic and tireless dedication to duty make They a vital core to many families, as well as organizations that uphold traditions, rules and standards, such as law offices, regulatory bodies and military. People with the XXXX personality type enjoy taking responsibility for their actions, and take pride in the work they do – when working towards a goal, They hold back none of their time and energy completing each relevant task with accuracy and patience."
ISTJ,"They don’t make many assumptions, preferring instead to analyze their surroundings, check their facts and arrive at practical courses of action. XXXX personalities are no-nonsense, and when they’ve made a decision, they will relay the facts necessary to achieve their goal, expecting others to grasp the situation immediately and take action. They have little tolerance for indecisiveness, but lose patience even more quickly if their chosen course is challenged with impractical theories, especially if they ignore key details – if challenges becomes time-consuming debates, They can become noticeably angry as deadlines tick nearer."
ISTJ,"When They say they are going to get something done, they do it, meeting their obligations no matter the personal cost, and they are baffled by people who don’t hold their own word in the same respect. Combining laziness and dishonesty is the quickest way to get on They’ bad side. Consequently, people with the XXXX personality type often prefer to work alone, or at least have their authority clearly established by hierarchy, where they can set and achieve their goals without debate or worry over other’s reliability."
ISTJ,"They have sharp, fact-based minds, and prefer autonomy and self-sufficiency to reliance on someone or something. Dependency on others is often seen by They as a weakness, and their passion for duty, dependability and impeccable personal integrity forbid falling into such a trap."
ISTJ,"This sense of personal integrity is core to They, and goes beyond their own minds – XXXX personalities adhere to established rules and guidelines regardless of cost, reporting their own mistakes and telling the truth even when the consequences for doing so could be disastrous. To They, honesty is far more important than emotional considerations, and their blunt approach leaves others with the false impression that They are cold, or even robotic. People with this type may struggle to express emotion or affection outwardly, but the suggestion that they don’t feel, or worse have no personality at all, is deeply hurtful."
ISTJ,"They’ dedication is an excellent quality, allowing them to accomplish much, but it is also a core weakness that less scrupulous individuals take advantage of. They seek stability and security, considering it their duty to maintain a smooth operation, and they may find that their coworkers and significant others shift their responsibilities onto them, knowing that they will always take up the slack. They tend to keep their opinions to themselves and let the facts do the talking, but it can be a long time before observable evidence tells the whole story."
ISTJ,"They need to remember to take care of themselves – their stubborn dedication to stability and efficiency can compromise those goals in the long term as others lean ever-harder on them, creating an emotional strain that can go unexpressed for years, only finally coming out after it’s too late to fix. If they can find coworkers and spouses who genuinely appreciate and complement their qualities, who enjoy the brightness, clarity and dependability that they offer, They will find that their stabilizing role is a tremendously satisfying one, knowing that they are part of a system that works.. Honest and Direct – Integrity is the heart of the XXXX personality type. Emotional manipulation, mind games and reassuring lies all run counter to They’ preference for managing the reality of the situations they encounter with plain and simple honesty.. Strong-willed and Dutiful – They embody that integrity in their actions too, working hard and staying focused on their goals. Patient and determined, people with the XXXX personality type meet their obligations, period.. Very Responsible – They’ word is a promise, and a promise means everything. They would rather run themselves into the ground with extra days and lost sleep than fail to deliver the results they said they would. Loyalty is a strong sentiment for XXXX personalities, and they fulfill their duties to the people and organizations they’ve committed themselves to.. Calm and Practical – None of their promises would mean much if They lost their tempers and broke down at every sign of hardship – they keep their feet on the ground and make clear, rational decisions. Peoples’ preferences are a factor to consider in this process, and They work to make the best use of individual qualities, but these decisions are made with effectiveness in mind more so than empathy. The same applies to criticisms, for others and themselves.. Create and Enforce Order – The primary goal of any XXXX is to be effective in what they’ve chosen to do, and they believe that this is accomplished best when everyone involved knows exactly what is going on and why. Unclear guidelines and people who break established rules undermine this effort, and are rarely tolerated by They. Structure and rules foster dependability; chaos creates unforeseen setbacks and missed deadlines.. Jacks-of-all-trades – Much like Analyst personality types, They are proud repositories of knowledge, though the emphasis is more on facts and statistics than concepts and underlying principles. This allows They to apply themselves to a variety of situations, picking up and applying new data and grasping the details of challenging situations as a matter of course."
ISTJ,"Stubborn – The facts are the facts, and They tend to resist any new idea that isn’t supported by them. This factual decision-making process also makes it difficult for people with the XXXX personality type to accept that they were wrong about something – but anyone can miss a detail, even them.. Insensitive – While not intentionally harsh, They often hurt more sensitive types’ feelings by the simple mantra that honesty is the best policy. XXXX personalities may take emotions into consideration, but really only so far as to determine the most effective way to say what needs to be said.. Always by the Book – They believe that things work best with clearly defined rules, but this makes them reluctant to bend those rules or try new things, even when the downside is minimal. Truly unstructured environments leave They all but paralyzed.. Judgmental – Opinions are opinions and facts are facts, and They are unlikely to respect people who disagree with those facts, or especially those who remain willfully ignorant of them.. Often Unreasonably Blame Themselves – All this can combine to make They believe they are the only ones who can see projects through reliably. As they load themselves with extra work and responsibilities, turning away good intentions and helpful ideas, They sooner or later hit a tipping point where they simply can’t deliver. Since they’ve heaped the responsibility on themselves, They then believe the responsibility for failure is theirs alone to bear."
ISTJ,"They are dependable through and through, and this trait is clearly expressed when it comes to their romantic relationships. Often representing the epitome of family values, people with the XXXX personality type are comfortable with, and often even encourage traditional household and gender roles, and look to a family structure guided by clear expectations and honesty. While their reserved nature often makes dating They challenging, they are truly dedicated partners, willing to devote tremendous thought and energy to ensure stable and mutually satisfying relationships."

While their reserved nature often makes dating They challenging, they are truly dedicated partners, willing to devote tremendous thought and energy to ensure stable and mutually satisfying relationships."
ISTJ,"Blind dates and random hookups are not They’ preferred methods for finding potential partners. The risk and unpredictability of these situations has They’ alarm bells ringing, and being dragged out for a night of dancing at the club just isn’t going to happen. XXXX personalities much prefer more responsible, conservative methods of dating, such as dinner with an interested coworker or, in their more adventurous moods, a setup organized through a mutual friend."
ISTJ,"They approach relationships, as with most things, from a rational perspective, looking for compatibility and the mutual satisfaction of daily and long-term needs. This isn’t a process that They take lightly, and once commitments are established, they stick to their promises to the very end. They establish foundations, fulfill their responsibilities, and keep their relationships functional and stable."
ISTJ,"While this may not translate into particularly exotic intimate lives, They are dependable lovers who want very much for their partners to remain satisfied. It takes patience on the part of more adventurous partners, but if different activities can be demonstrated as equally or more enjoyable than those already within They’ comfort zones, they are perfectly capable of trying something new."
ISTJ,"However, emotional satisfaction can be another matter. While They are able to provide surprisingly good emotional support, this only happens when they realize that it’s necessary, and there’s the rub. They are not naturally receptive to others’ emotions, not unless they are stated clearly, and a partner usually only says “I’m angry” when it’s too late to address the initial grievance."
ISTJ,"People with the XXXX personality type can get so caught up in the belief in their correctness, in “winning” arguments they thought were about facts, that they don’t realize their partner may have viewed things from a perspective of consideration and sensitivity. Especially with more sensitive partners, this can be a huge challenge for the relationship. Ultimately though, They’ senses of responsibility and dedication set the tone, and they spare no effort in noting to this distinction moving forward, the consequences having been demonstrated as real."
ISTJ,"While They’ staid approach may seem boring to some, there is an undeniable attractiveness to it, though felt perhaps more by respect and admiration than emotional passion. They’ shells hide a strong and quiet determination and reliability, rare among other personality types, which can benefit even the flightiest personalities, allowing them to stay connected to the real world while still exploring new territory. Partners who share the Observant (S) trait are the best fit for XXXX personalities, with one or two opposing traits to create balance and to expand They’ sometimes overly isolated world, such as partners with Extraverted (E) or Prospecting (P) traits."
ISTJ,"XXXX friends are not spontaneous. They are not talkative, or particularly playful in their affection. What XXXX friends are is loyal, trustworthy, honorable and dependable. Others may come and go with the ups and downs of life, but They stay by their friends’ sides no matter what, with a deepness of commitment that other types may not even believe is possible."
ISTJ,"They are a very methodical personality type, and this loyalty isn’t given away lightly. Often slow to make friends, They usually end up with a smaller circle, but they consider that circle to represent a promise to be there for the people they care about, and They’ promises are not easily broken."
ISTJ,"Expressing emotional affection isn’t one of They’ stronger skills, but they nevertheless find ways to show it. As Socrates said, “To be is to do”, and They’ follow-through, their willingness to take action as a show of support, stands in for their words."
ISTJ,"But all of this sounds terribly serious, and indeed it only shows the one side of They and their approach to their friendships. The other side knows how to stop being quite so staid, and especially in the company of joyful and talkative Extraverts (E), They enjoy relaxing and having fun with a good discussion about work, life, and current events."
ISTJ,"People with the XXXX personality type don’t like conflict, and this applies to how they select their friends as well. Seeking out friends with similar principles and opinions, They most often befriend other Sentinels personalities, who are likely to share their perspective and world vision. While they are unlikely to become friends with substantially different types – it simply takes too much energy to bridge the communication gap – XXXX personalities still recognize and appreciate others’ strengths and qualities."

While they are unlikely to become friends with substantially different types – it simply takes too much energy to bridge the communication gap – XXXX personalities still recognize and appreciate others’ strengths and qualities."
ISTJ,"As parents, people with the XXXX personality type are often the most comfortable. Their sense of responsibility and honor blends well with a tradition that has been in place since time immemorial: to raise one’s children to be respected, contributing members of home and society. As with most commitments, They do not take their roles as parents lightly, and will make it their work to ensure that this tradition is upheld to the highest standard."
ISTJ,"This doesn’t always come easily for their children though, as They tend to be strict, with high standards and expectations. XXXX personalities establish stable, clearly structured environments for their children, always with an eye on helping them to develop a sense of place in society, and to fulfill useful roles."
ISTJ,"All this loyalty, devotion and structure are of little use though when They’ children need the warmth of emotional support. While They can be sensitive towards those they care about in their own way, it’s hard for younger children and especially adolescents to recognize this tough love for the love that it is. Often They need to rely on a more sensitive partner to fill this role and mediate between rational purpose and the more ethereal sense of emotional well-being."
ISTJ,"People with the XXXX personality type are strongly principled, valuing patience and hard work, qualities children often struggle with. Nevertheless, They’ children are expected to meet these standards and share these values, for their own good. This approach often bears its fruit in the long run, but They must keep in mind that their approach creates natural barriers and distance that often leave their children wondering if they’re on the same team."
ISTJ,"Taken too far, or with mutual stubbornness, this may even set in as a permanent state in the relationship, something both XXXX parents and their children ultimately regret. It is best for They to embrace and hold to their own values, but to also recognize that each person has their own goals, and to meet their children halfway in attaining theirs. Combining their natural devotion and purpose with this flexibility in support of their children’s own vision leads to a sense of mutual respect and accomplishment that any XXXX parent would be proud of."
ISTJ,"While many personality types may be comfortable with flexible work as consultants and sole proprietors, They are much more focused on building long-term, stable careers. That’s not to say that They can’t do that sort of work – many find themselves thinking about what’s on the other side of those cubical walls – but what they crave is dependability, and that is reflected in their choice of work perhaps more so than in any other part of their lives."
ISTJ,"The facts support this, as the most common careers among people with the XXXX personality type revolve around institutions of respected tradition, authority, security, and established consistency. Careers as military officers, lawyers, judges, police officers and detectives are all very popular among They. This makes sense, as they not only offer the stability that They seek, but are in line with their principles and conservatism, establishing clear societal roles."
ISTJ,"They of course aren’t limited to these organizations – there are many other roles that utilize their reliability, objectivity and sharp eyes. When facts and logic are out of place, XXXX personalities swoop in as the accountants, auditors, data analysts, financial managers, business administrators and even doctors that identify, report and correct the issues at hand."
ISTJ,"Most of these careers have They working alone, which is usually their preference, but when teams are necessary, they are best defined by clearly outlined roles, responsibilities and work environments."
ISTJ,"They have strong opinions about how things should be done, and if things are shuffled too often, people with this personality type can become surprisingly vocal about their opposition. It’s important for They to remember that even the most traditional and stable career paths can and need to change as time goes by. It is much better to accept this with grace than to develop reputations of being enemies of new ideas."
ISTJ,"They may also struggle with the increasingly open and social requirements of modern work life. Being somewhat bad at sensing others feelings, They’ “just the facts” attitude can be downright alienating when it comes to more sensitive personality types. This applies not just to coworkers but to customers as well – service positions like retail sales and waiting tables, as well as more emotionally demanding careers such as psychiatry are, generally speaking, a terrible fit."
ISTJ,"The ideal career paths feature a trend: they place facts above feelings and allow They to uphold the hard standards that are the backbone of society. Rules are the basis for everything people take for granted about modern life, from the social contract that smooths relationships, to the laws that protect peoples’ most basic safety, to the constitutions and treaties that govern nations. People with the XXXX personality type take on roles as the defenders of these ideas, in big ways and small, and are rightfully proud of it."
ISTJ,"When it comes to the workplace, They are almost a stereotype for the classic hard-working, dutiful employee. In all positions, the XXXX personality type seeks structure, clearly defined rules, and respect for authority and hierarchy. Responsibilities aren’t burdens to They, they are the trust that has been placed in them, an opportunity to prove once again that they are the right person for the job."
ISTJ,"On the other hand, the change that comes with assuming those new responsibilities, or in losing old ones, is often a significant struggle for They. This presents itself differently in different positions of authority, but it is one of They’ most significant challenges to overcome. The usual insensitivity common to all Thinking (T) types is also a running theme here, something many people with the XXXX personality type choose to focus on in their personal and professional development."

ISTJ,"Among colleagues, no one can be trusted more to ensure that projects are finished on time and by the book than They. Quiet and methodical, people with the XXXX personality type keep cool when the going gets tough, but expect their colleagues to share their approach. Significantly different types, especially more emotional ones, baffle They with their need for emotional support and openness, or capacity for dropping something, half finished. To They, either something’s been done right or it’s been done wrong, and sugarcoating it or walking away isn’t going to fix it."
ISTJ,"They value peace and security in the workplace, and the easiest way for this to happen is for them to simply work alone. Innovations, brainstorming, theories and new ideas all disrupt this comfortable state, and it takes a great deal of respect on They’ part to acknowledge their validity. Once the details have been laid out and a plan of implementation established though, They are an indispensable part of the team in putting these ideas into practice."
ISTJ,"They love responsibility and the power resulting from it. Pressing themselves hard to meet their obligations, They regularly go above and beyond their duties, and expect their subordinates to act with the same level of dedication. At the same time, They’ preference for doing things by the book, adherence to hierarchy, and general aversion to innovation makes their subordinates ride a very thin line when they do – stepping out of bounds must be backed up with just the facts, and results."
ISTJ,"It is said that it is better to do first and ask permission later – it’s difficult to say whether this applies to They, as they are very intolerant of their subordinates’ failures to meet their obligations, and one of those obligations is to stick to the plan. Believing that truth, at least as far as they see it, is more important than sensitivity, XXXX personalities are capable of laying down hard criticism, and their willingness to make tough decisions can make perceived insubordination the final trespass."
ISTJ,"Few personality types are as practical and dedicated as They. Known for their reliability and hard work, They are good at creating and maintaining a secure and stable environment for themselves and their loved ones. They’ dedication is invaluable in many areas, including their own personal growth."
ISFJ,"XXXX (XXXX) is someone with the Introverted, Observant, Feeling, and Judging personality traits. These people tend to be warm and unassuming in their own steady way. They’re efficient and responsible, giving careful attention to practical details in their daily lives."
ISFJ,"The XXXX personality type is quite unique, as many of their qualities defy the definition of their individual traits. Though sensitive, They have excellent analytical abilities; though reserved, they have well-developed people skills and robust social relationships; and though they are generally a conservative type, They are often receptive to change and new ideas. As with so many things, people with the XXXX personality type are more than the sum of their parts, and it is the way they use these strengths that defines who they are."
ISFJ,"There’s hardly a better type to make up such a large proportion of the population, nearly 13%. Combining the best of tradition and the desire to do good, They are found in lines of work with a sense of history behind them, such as medicine, academics and charitable social work."
ISFJ,"XXXX personalities (especially Turbulent ones) are often meticulous to the point of perfectionism, and though they procrastinate, they can always be relied on to get the job done on time. They take their responsibilities personally, consistently going above and beyond, doing everything they can to exceed expectations and delight others, at work and at home."
ISFJ,"The challenge for They is ensuring that what they do is noticed. They have a tendency to underplay their accomplishments, and while their kindness is often respected, more cynical and selfish people are likely to take advantage of They’ dedication and humbleness by pushing work onto them and then taking the credit. They need to know when to say no and stand up for themselves if they are to maintain their confidence and enthusiasm."
ISFJ,"Naturally social, an odd quality for Introverts, They utilize excellent memories not to retain data and trivia, but to remember people, and details about their lives. When it comes to gift-giving, They have no equal, using their imagination and natural sensitivity to express their generosity in ways that touch the hearts of their recipients. While this is certainly true of their coworkers, whom people with the XXXX personality type often consider their personal friends, it is in family that their expressions of affection fully bloom."
ISFJ,"XXXX personalities are a wonderful group, rarely sitting idle while a worthy cause remains unfinished. They’ ability to connect with others on an intimate level is unrivaled among Introverts, and the joy they experience in using those connections to maintain a supportive, happy family is a gift for everyone involved. They may never be truly comfortable in the spotlight, and may feel guilty taking due credit for team efforts, but if they can ensure that their efforts are recognized, They are likely to feel a level of satisfaction in what they do that many other personality types can only dream of.. Supportive – They are the universal helpers, sharing their knowledge, experience, time and energy with anyone who needs it, and all the more so with friends and family. People with this personality type strive for win-win situations, choosing empathy over judgment whenever possible.. Reliable and Patient – Rather than offering sporadic, excited rushes that leave things half finished, They are meticulous and careful, taking a steady approach and bending with the needs of the situation just enough to accomplish their end goals. They not only ensure that things are done to the highest standard, but often go well beyond what is required.. Imaginative and Observant – They are very imaginative, and use this quality as an accessory to empathy, observing others’ emotional states and seeing things from their perspective. With their feet firmly planted on the ground, it is a very practical imagination, though they do find things quite fascinating and inspiring.. Enthusiastic – When the goal is right, They take all this support, reliability and imagination and apply it to something they believe will make a difference in people’s lives – whether fighting poverty with a global initiative or simply making a customer’s day.. Loyal and Hard-Working – Given a little time, this enthusiasm grows into loyalty – XXXX personalities often form an emotional attachment to the ideas and organizations they’ve dedicated themselves to. Anything short of meeting their obligations with good, hard work fails their own expectations.. Good Practical Skills – The best part is, They have the practical sense to actually do something with all this altruism. If mundane, routine tasks are what need to be done, They can see the beauty and harmony that they create, because they know that it helps them to care for their friends, family, and anyone else who needs it."
ISFJ,"Humble and Shy – The meek shall inherit the earth, but it’s a long road if they receive no recognition at all. This is possibly They’ biggest challenge, as they are so concerned with others’ feelings that they refuse to make their thoughts known, or to take any duly earned credit for their contributions. They’ standards for themselves are also so high that, knowing they could have done some minor aspect of a task better, they often downplay their successes entirely.. Take Things Too Personally – They have trouble separating personal and impersonal situations – any situation is still an interaction between two people, after all – and any negativity from conflict or criticism can carry over from their professional to their personal lives, and back again.. Repress Their Feelings – People with the XXXX personality type are private and very sensitive, internalizing their feelings a great deal. Much in the way that They protect others’ feelings, they must protect their own, and this lack of healthy emotional expression can lead to a lot of stress and frustration.. Overload Themselves – Their strong senses of duty and perfectionism combine with this aversion to emotional conflict to create a situation where it is far too easy for They to overload themselves – or to be overloaded by others – as they struggle silently to meet everyone’s expectations, especially their own.. Reluctant to Change – These challenges can be particularly hard to address since XXXX personalities value traditions and history highly in their decisions. A situation sometimes needs to reach a breaking point before They are persuaded by circumstance, or the strong personality of a loved one, to alter course.. Too Altruistic – This is all compounded and reinforced by They’ otherwise wonderful quality of altruism. Being such warm, good-natured people, They are willing to let things slide, to believe that things will get better soon, to not burden others by accepting their offers of help, while their troubles mount unassisted."
ISFJ,"When it comes to romantic relationships, They’ kindness grows into a joy that is only found in taking care of their family and home, in being there for emotional and practical support whenever it’s needed. Home is where the heart is for people with the XXXX personality type, and in no other area of their lives do they strive with such dedication to create the harmony and beauty they wish to see in the world."
ISFJ,"The trouble is, these are the benefits of an established long-term relationship, and They’ unbearable shyness means it can take a long time to reach this point. They are most attractive when they are simply being themselves in a comfortable environment such as work, where their natural flow shows this kindness and dedication. Relationships built on established familiarity are a warm prospect for They – they take dating seriously and only enter into relationships that have a real chance of lasting a lifetime."
ISFJ,"They’ shyness and sensitivity shield what are, beneath the surface, incredibly strong feelings. While not always obvious to others, this river of emotion can’t be taken lightly or for granted – XXXX personalities can value the idea of committed romance almost as highly as some regard religious beliefs. Hard as it may be, if either dating partner doubts their feelings, they must part ways before real emotional damage is done."
ISFJ,"As their relationships do progress, They often continue to struggle with emotional expression, but they have the opportunity to let physical affection stand in for their loving words. People with this personality type take no greater joy than in pleasing others, often even considering this a personal duty, and this applies to intimacy as well. While dutiful sex may not sound especially attractive in those specific terms, intimacy is tremendously important to They, and they spare no effort in this department."
ISFJ,"Nor is the pleasure they take in ensuring their partners’ happiness limited to the bedroom – They spend an enormous amount of time and energy finding ways to keep their relationship satisfying for their partners. All they ask in return is commitment, love and, perhaps most of all, appreciation."
ISFJ,"However, not everyone is prepared to pay even that small price for the benefit of They’ kindness. If their partners aren’t willing or able to express this thanks, or worse still are openly critical of their XXXX partners, they will find that, given time and pressure, all of those repressed emotions can burst forth in massive verbal attacks that all the future regret in the world won’t blunt."
ISFJ,"These outbursts are something to watch out for, but the more pervasive issue in They’ relationships is that it can be too easy for their altruism and kindness to be taken advantage of, maybe even without their partners realizing it, while leaving They’ own needs and dreams unfulfilled. This is something that They’ partners, and XXXX personalities themselves, must look after if they want the sort of long, fulfilling relationships they dream about. Expressing appreciation is often more than just the right words, it is reciprocation."
ISFJ,"While perfectly capable in the workplace and among friends, They’ true passions lie in taking care of their families, from playing with their children to the mundane needs of the household, efforts They are only too happy to contribute."
ISFJ,"They are trustworthy, loyal, loving and faithful and nothing brings them more joy than the commitment of an appreciative and thriving relationship. The best matches are those who share these sensibilities, namely those who share the Observant (S) trait, with one or two opposing traits to ensure that both partners have room to grow, develop and help each other along, ’til the end of their days."
ISFJ,"Given how generous They are with their warm praise and support, it’s not surprising that others enjoy their company enough to call them friends. The challenge is to be considered a friend back – people with the XXXX personality type are shy and a little protective of themselves, but they also need to be able to connect on a deeper emotional level. It makes sense then that most of They’ friends are made not by random encounters on a wild night out, but through comfortable and consistent contact, as in class or in the workplace where they have the time to get to know each other little by little."
ISFJ,"They need a lot of positive feedback, and admitting this need certainly shows vulnerability, but if that vulnerability is well handled, it creates the deep bonds that XXXX personalities look for. If badly handled or not reciprocated, it’s hard to see the burgeoning friendship surviving without quite a bit of extra effort."
ISFJ,"Yet, as their friendships develop, They’ sense of loyalty may push them to lean ever more on themselves to meet their friends’ needs, to the point of neglecting their own. They show this in a few ways, from going clearly out of their ways to stick to even trivial commitments, to simply not wanting to disagree or say no for fear of causing turbulence. More cynical types would call this naïve, and may even take advantage of They’ altruism – but these are hardly the type of people who could be called “friends”, and they have no business being discussed here."
ISFJ,"The real friends, those close inner circles, are the ones They truly cherish for their quality of character and quality of discussion. They aren’t particularly picky about what personality types they make friends with, at least not initially, but because they prefer so strongly to avoid conflict and miscommunication, most of their friends are likely to end up being fairly similar personalities."
ISFJ,"From the start, They’ altruism is apparent in their approach towards their children, ensuring that they have a safe, stable environment filled with love, care and support. In their children’s younger years, They’ patience comes in very handy as well, as their children learn to become more independent and self-deterministic, testing any limit they can find."
ISFJ,"They’ warmth and care make parenting something that often comes naturally to them. Many people with this personality type feel like parenting is the task they were born for, taking no small pleasure in the sense of personal importance and responsibility they feel in ensuring that their children grow up to be healthy, confident and successful. At the same time, They are anything but arrogant, and will hardly take their natural skill in this department for granted."
ISFJ,"Very traditional personality types, They accept historic standards, with clearly defined roles as parents and children. They view their role, and often rightly so, as the imparter of their own wisdom and values, ensuring that their children understand the importance of dedication and responsibility."
ISFJ,"What many XXXX parents may not realize is that more independent children often reject the seemingly overbearing love and support that make XXXX personalities such wonderful parental figures. They wish to determine their own values and make their own choices, and They’ good intentions can make them feel like every aspect of their lives is sealed off and controlled. All the while, XXXX parents must ensure that more dependent children, who are willing to lean on all of this care and support rather than rebel against it, do not take these admirable qualities for granted, neglecting their own independence entirely."
ISFJ,"They are uncomfortable when their children don’t behave as expected, and oftentimes more insightful children see, and sometimes exploit, this potential weakness with tantrums and mind games. It takes a strong will for They to put their foot down and teach clear and reasonable boundaries and values, while at the same time affording their children the freedom to grow and develop on their own."
ISFJ,"Parenting is not easy for any personality type, not if they’re doing it right, but They do have the advantage of not just being caring, but being thoughtful and responsible in how they administer that care. Often seen as ideal parents, people with the XXXX personality type are able to be there for their children, but to also know that there’s more to people than meets the eye, and to respect those differences – if not always to understand them."
ISFJ,"In many ways, They are the backbone of the modern workforce. Altruistic and well-rounded, no other personality type is so well-suited to be of service of others. It is no surprise that many They are not just good at supporting their coworkers and customers in human resources and support positions, they genuinely enjoy it, as it gives them the chance to calm frustrations, see things through to a practical solution, and to be thanked, appreciated, at the close of each ordeal."
ISFJ,"They are skilled at remembering things about others which makes them not only valuable assistants, but well-liked colleagues. People with the XXXX personality type can always be counted on to remember a birthday, a graduation, or simply a frequent customers’ name, and that can make all the difference. Add to these amiable qualities They’ meticulousness, hard work and dedication, and it’s no surprise that their careers often progress smoothly, with few of the ups and downs that accompany more high-flying types."
ISFJ,"However, They are unlikely to actively seek out managerial positions, and are still more unlikely to brag about their accomplishments. XXXX personalities prefer to be rewarded by seeing first-hand the positive impact of their efforts, and will remain enthusiastic simply knowing that what they do is genuinely appreciated by the people they care for. This makes them natural counselors, technical support, and interior designers, where they are able to help others one-on-one without having to worry about corporate politics."
ISFJ,"Respecting tradition and security, They have no problem with the idea of moving along in a structured hierarchy, and while they may not always seek out these managerial positions, they fill them well. They are well-tuned to others’ emotions and have a strong sense of practicality, extending their own ability to get things done to their teams."
ISFJ,"Where They struggle is in generating new ideas and in grasping abstract concepts – fields like academic research and corporate strategy are too intangible and too impersonal to utilize They’ strengths. Similar challenges arise in more typical careers when changes are forced through by They’ employers – advance warning and a proper explanation can help to smooth the shock, but if the changes cut back on things like the quality of customer service, it can feel like a betrayal in the face of their loyalty and dedication."
ISFJ,"Strong, well-developed institutions alongside like-minded friends are attractive workplaces for people with the XXXX personality type, and careers as nurses, elementary school teachers and social and religious workers are attractive options. Sometimes the desire to help others is enough in itself – it’s not uncommon to find They volunteering and helping the community at shelters, food banks and their children’s schools. They are warm, service-oriented people, and hardly anyone is more welcome in these (and many, many other) roles."
ISFJ,"Whether subordinates, colleagues or managers, They share the goal of putting good service and dedication above all else. Whether helping customers directly, helping coworkers get projects finished on time or helping teams keep organized and productive, people with the XXXX personality type can always be relied on for their kindness and ability to listen to concerns, and to find ways to resolve them. Win-win situations are They’ bread and butter, and no one takes quite the same pleasure in finding satisfying resolutions to day-to-day challenges."
ISFJ,"As subordinates, They exemplify the strength of humble dedication. Relied on and respected for their patience and commitment, XXXX personalities really only seek one reward for their work: the satisfaction of knowing that whoever they helped feels heartfelt thanks. On the other hand, this humbleness can hold them back – They are quite unwilling to advertise their achievements, often for fear of creating unnecessary friction, which makes it too easy for them to be overlooked when opportunities come along."
ISFJ,"They are people of incredible loyalty, often trying to follow favored managers to new positions and locations. This contrasts with their usual feelings on change which, if it compromises their principles (as cutbacks to customer care might), is met with stress and unhappiness. Though perfectly capable of accepting change, They must feel that it’s for the right reasons. If a policy change results in disappointed customers, They take it very personally."
ISFJ,"Among their colleagues, people with this personality type seek a frictionless environment, a spirit of friends helping friends to get the job done. Close-knit and supportive teams are what They enjoy most, allowing them to express their altruistic spirit among people who rely on their dedication and warmth. They are natural networkers, but they use this skill to keep things running smoothly, not as a tool for professional advancement."
ISFJ,"These qualities can be drawbacks though, as They’ aversion to conflict and desire to help can be abused by less scrupulous colleagues. Instead of only asking help when they need it, some may ask for help when they just don’t feel like working hard, knowing that their XXXX colleagues have a hard time saying no. The result is that They can become overburdened and stressed, and it takes a few good workplace friends to put pressure on these less savory characters in order to maintain balance."
ISFJ,"While management isn’t necessarily at the top of They’ list of goals, it is a natural progression as their hard work and good people skills are recognized over the years. Oftentimes they don’t actually enjoy managing others, but this can be one of their greatest strengths – as managers, They are warm, approachable and great listeners. Having no real desire to issue authoritarian dictates from some high tower, XXXX personalities prefer to work alongside their subordinates, organizing people and minimizing conflict."
ISFJ,"This helps them to create personal relationships with their subordinates, to be friends in the workplace who simply have different sets of responsibilities. While they may be slow to accept some changes, they are great at helping their teams put them into practice once they’ve been agreed on. They may be too sensitive to be fully executive material, but they make exemplary floor and office managers who know what it takes to satisfy their customers."
ISFJ,"Few personality types are as practical and dedicated as They. Known for their reliability and altruism, They are good at creating and maintaining a secure and stable environment for themselves and their loved ones. They’ dedication is invaluable in many areas, including their own personal growth."
ESTJ,"An XXXX (XXXX) is someone with the Extraverted, Observant, Thinking, and Judging personality traits. They possess great fortitude, emphatically following their own sensible judgment. They often serve as a stabilizing force among others, able to offer solid direction amid adversity."
ESTJ,"They are representatives of tradition and order, utilizing their understanding of what is right, wrong and socially acceptable to bring families and communities together. Embracing the values of honesty, dedication and dignity, people with the XXXX personality type are valued for their clear advice and guidance, and they happily lead the way on difficult paths. Taking pride in bringing people together, They often take on roles as community organizers, working hard to bring everyone together in celebration of cherished local events, or in defense of the traditional values that hold families and communities together."
ESTJ,"Demand for such leadership is high in democratic societies, and forming no less than 11% of the population, it’s no wonder that many of America’s presidents have been They. Strong believers in the rule of law and authority that must be earned, XXXX personalities lead by example, demonstrating dedication and purposeful honesty, and an utter rejection of laziness and cheating, especially in work. If anyone declares hard, manual work to be an excellent way to build character, it is They."
ESTJ,"They are aware of their surroundings and live in a world of clear, verifiable facts – the surety of their knowledge means that even against heavy resistance, they stick to their principles and push an unclouded vision of what is and is not acceptable. Their opinions aren’t just empty talk either, as They are more than willing to dive into the most challenging projects, improving action plans and sorting details along the way, making even the most complicated tasks seem easy and approachable."
ESTJ,"However, They don’t work alone, and they expect their reliability and work ethic to be reciprocated – people with this personality type meet their promises, and if partners or subordinates jeopardize them through incompetence or laziness, or worse still, dishonesty, they do not hesitate to show their wrath. This can earn them a reputation for inflexibility, a trait shared by all Sentinel personalities, but it’s not because They are arbitrarily stubborn, but because they truly believe that these values are what make society work."
ESTJ,"The main challenge for They is to recognize that not everyone follows the same path or contributes in the same way. A true leader recognizes the strength of the individual, as well as that of the group, and helps bring those individuals’ ideas to the table. That way, They really do have all the facts, and are able to lead the charge in directions that work for everyone.. Dedicated – Seeing things to completion borders on an ethical obligation for They. Tasks aren’t simply abandoned because they’ve become difficult or boring – people with the XXXX personality type take them up when they are the right thing to do, and they will be finished so long as they remain the right thing to do.. Strong-willed – A strong will makes this dedication possible, and They don’t give up their beliefs because of simple opposition. They defend their ideas and principles relentlessly, and must be proven clearly and conclusively wrong for their stance to budge.. Direct and Honest – They trust facts far more than abstract ideas or opinions. Straightforward statements and information are king, and XXXX personalities return the honesty (whether it’s wanted or not).. Loyal, Patient and Reliable – They work to exemplify truthfulness and reliability, considering stability and security very important. When They say they’ll do something, they keep their word, making them very responsible members of their families, companies and communities.. Enjoy Creating Order – Chaos makes things unpredictable, and unpredictable things can’t be trusted when they are needed most – with this in mind, They strive to create order and security in their environments by establishing rules, structures and clear roles.. Excellent Organizers – This commitment to truth and clear standards makes They capable and confident leaders. People with this personality type have no problem distributing tasks and responsibilities to others fairly and objectively, making them excellent administrators.. Inflexible and Stubborn – The problem with being so fixated on what works is that They too often dismiss what might work better. Everything is opinion until proven, and XXXX personalities are reluctant to trust an opinion long enough for it to have that chance.. Uncomfortable with Unconventional Situations – They are strong adherents to tradition and when suddenly forced to try unvetted solutions, they become uncomfortable and stressed. New ideas suggest that their methods weren’t good enough, and abandoning what has always worked before in favor of something that may yet fail risks their image of reliability.. Judgmental – They have strong convictions about what is right, wrong, and socially acceptable. They’ compulsion to create order often extends to all things and everyone, ignoring the possibility that there are two right ways to get things done. They do not hesitate to let these “deviants” know what they think, considering it their duty to set things right.. Too Focused on Social Status – They take pride in the respect of their friends, colleagues and community and while difficult to admit, are very concerned with public opinion. They (especially Turbulent ones) can get so caught up in meeting others’ expectations that they fail to address their own needs.. Difficult to Relax – This need for respect fosters a need to maintain their dignity, which can make it difficult to cut loose and relax for risk of looking the fool, even in good fun.. Difficulty Expressing Emotion – This is all evidence of They’ greatest weakness: expressing emotions and feeling empathy. People with the XXXX personality type get so caught up in the facts and most effective methods that they forget to think of what makes others happy, or of their sensitivity. A detour can be breathtakingly beautiful, a joy for the family, but They may only see the consequence of arriving at their destination an hour late, hurting their loved ones by rejecting the notion too harshly."
ESTJ,"They are fairly unique in that their relationships don’t really change as they progress from the dating phase into more steady, long-term relationships and further into marriage. Because they value honesty and straightforwardness so highly, people with the XXXX personality type are likely to be clear about who they are, what they’re like and what their goals are from the start, and to stick to those statements long-term. So long as their partner is able to take them at their word and follow suit, they are bound to be extremely stable relationships."
ESTJ,"They are fairly unique in that their relationships don’t really change as they progress from the dating phase into more steady, long-term relationships and further into marriage. Because they value honesty and straightforwardness so highly, people with the XXXX personality type are likely to be clear about who they are, what they’re like and what their goals are from the start, and to stick to those statements long-term. So long as their partner is able to take them at their word and follow suit, they are bound to be extremely stable relationships."
ESTJ,"This may all sound a little stale, and indeed They are not spontaneous or unpredictable people, but they do very much enjoy taking their partners out and having fun. Social events and activities are They’ idea of a good time, and while they may rely on familiar people and places, they do bring lots of energy and enthusiasm, which helps keep things interesting."
ESTJ,"They approach intimacy with similarly physical, active intentions, and from fairly traditional ones as well. Wild ideas and poetry are for less mature personalities, or so They might say, though they do appreciate recognition and well-placed compliments to maintain high self-esteem. They may look for more stability in their sex lives than most, but They never fail to bring their characteristic vigor."
ESTJ,"This hints at a challenge in They’ relationships though, and that is emotional intimacy. Touchy-feely moments are few, as are verbal statements of love; this is usually fine, as XXXX personalities find other, more tangible ways to express their affection. The problem is in recognizing the validity of those qualities in others, rather than simply dismissing them as pointless or irrational, something that can be extremely hurtful if They’ partners are more sensitive."
ESTJ,"They address conflict head-on with simple statements of fact – a very rational approach – but subtlety and emotional tact are sacrificed in the process. While They’ level-headed, calm approach is appreciated by many, for others it is an uncomfortably direct approach. For all their social skills, They are especially bad at reading the emotional side of other people, and when it comes to their partners, it’s more important than ever to try to improve."
ESTJ,"They are people of strong principles and strong self-confidence. They use these qualities to protect their partners with admirable consistency. But people with the XXXX personality type are also stubborn, with a firm belief in their rightness, and they can quickly damage more sensitive partners’ fragile feelings. With this in mind, it is often best for They to find fellow Observant (S) partners in order to minimize communication barriers, with one or two opposing traits to balance their forceful character and provide opportunities for growth."
ESTJ,"They are strong, traditional friends who appreciate loyalty and shared values. Friendships with the XXXX personality type are often defined by their mutual activities and routines, by external factors, more so than the sense of intellectual or mystical compatibility that many Analyst and Diplomat personalities share among themselves. But this in no way diminishes the relationships – They’ friendships of dependability and mutual interest can be powerful connections that endure life’s changes with immutable constancy."
ESTJ,"Among their established friends, They show themselves to be outgoing and enthusiastic, always more than happy to bring others along for some healthy sport and outdoor activity. They sometimes get a little overbearing in their push for participation, but it’s just because they want everyone to have a good time. They’ friends are never short on invites to social activities and events, from tickets to a local ball game, to a weekend camping trip, to Sunday BBQ."
ESTJ,"They seek strong friendships founded on trust and loyalty (though loyalty to family does come first). Active and with quick minds, people with the XXXX personality type can’t ever be accused of not doing enough to fend off a little boredom. While They may not always be the life of the party, they know how to play their part in making sure their friends have a good time."
ESTJ,"The way They establish and maintain their friendships does limit the pool though, as they tend to seek out people who are similar to themselves, who share their respect for traditions and institutions. XXXX personalities are naturally stubborn, and it can be hard for them to find enough common ground with people who constantly disagree with their principles and beliefs to really form those ties of friendship."
ESTJ,"They’ challenge in friendship isn’t about finding fun things to do or people to do them with, but in finding diversity in their friends and activities. For all their community participation, They struggle immensely in even fully listening to differing opinions, let alone befriending people who consistently express alternate viewpoints. Whether about local political issues or the validity of a more emotional, idealistic disposition than they think is reasonable, They should make an effort to truly understand these alternate viewpoints."
ESTJ,"Exposing themselves to new ideas among acquaintances who think differently can do no harm – either people with the XXXX personality type discover better ways and a stronger foundation, or they gain all the more confidence in their beliefs for having successfully defended them. Just as They may think those loners who spend their lives in their basements playing video games need to get out more, They themselves need to make sure they get out of their own bubbles of unchallenged opinions and beliefs."
ESTJ,"They’ mantra of “hard work, tradition, respect” is best exemplified in their relationships with their children. In many ways, people with the XXXX personality type are the classic 50’s era father figure – very strict, and guardians of family traditions who have no trouble when it comes to enforcing the rules and standards they’ve established. Often seen as model citizens, They expect their children to carry that image, continuing the example they’ve set by being polite and respectful – insubordination is not tolerated."
ESTJ,"This view is of course extended to their children, and as soon as they are able, their children are expected to contribute in their own way, by cleaning their plates and their rooms and going to bed on time – by maintaining the order of things."
ESTJ,"This inflexibility can become a challenge as their children grow into their more naturally rebellious adolescent years. They defend their own, and their relationships with their children are no different, but they expect their children to adhere to the structures they’ve put in place to ensure that protection. They enjoy creating secure, stable environments, and consider it an affront to have those considerations rejected – again, insubordination is not tolerated."
ESTJ,"It’s not that they have wild, high-flying hopes of perfection for their children – They are down-to-earth people and simply want to see their children develop into respected, responsible adults. But XXXX personalities also want their children to be strong-willed and capable, and that is something that can only happen when they have the chance to make their own decisions, and the chance to face the consequences of those decisions, good or bad, with the love and support of their parents."
ESTJ,"They may face challenges as their children learn to balance a growing desire for independence with the respect and adherence to their duties required of them, but They do have a clear advantage of consistency and direct honesty that never leaves their expectations ambiguous. It can be a tall order, but They’ children always know what they need to bring, and most will recognize and appreciate the dedication and hard work their parents brought in return."
ESTJ,"They’ career paths are often as clear and straightforward as they are themselves. Though there are many directions they can choose to go, people with the XXXX personality type almost always end up in situations where they have the opportunity to exercise their affinity for organization, structure, and follow-through. Providing further focus, They share a profound respect for tradition, stability and security, qualities which lend themselves well to progressing along clear paths to increased responsibility and dependability."
ESTJ,"They’ sense of loyalty results in them staying with a single employer as long as possible, and their reverence for established institutions often leads to work with well-respected organizations. Law enforcement, military service, hospitals and prominent legal firms are all able to recognize They’ long years of service."
ESTJ,"They are the image of the model citizen, and they strive to maintain this ideal throughout their careers. This helps them move forward into management as well – people with this personality type have many traits inherent to leadership, something that is often recognized regardless of their chosen industry. From the genuine enjoyment They feel in organizing other people to their knack for clearly expressing their principles, values and expectations, They are extremely effective managers."
ESTJ,"Also fearsome leaders, They loathe disorganization, ineptitude, laziness and especially dishonesty, and when these values are crossed, XXXX personalities do not hesitate to let their disapproval show. So long as everyone plays by the rules, They are incredibly efficient, their love of structure and thoroughness leaving a record of accurate, complete work that is on time and on budget. They are natural auditors, financial officers and business administrators, and any such and similar roles are excellent choices for them."
ESTJ,"Hard work and self-motivation are also strong XXXX principles, which makes them excellent sales representatives, whether in basic retail positions, part of office teams, or as independent agents. People with the XXXX personality type stick to projects until they’re finished, big or small, and are organized enough to make any necessary paperwork a mere minor inconvenience to their clients, rather than some baffling ordeal. These qualities combine to make the clear steps in advancement that They require in order to maintain a sense of accomplishment not just viable, but almost inevitable."
ESTJ,"They show clear and consistent tendencies, and these are especially visible in the workplace. Whether subordinates, among colleagues or as managers, people with the XXXX personality type create order, follow the rules, and work to ensure that their work and the work of those around them is completed to the highest standards. Cutting corners and shirking responsibility are the quickest ways to lose They’ respect."
ESTJ,"They are hard-working and do things by the book. Though sometimes stubborn and inflexible, especially when presented with ideas that haven’t been fully developed, XXXX personalities are open to new methods that can be demonstrated to be better. However, They are unlikely to do much experimenting on their own – adhering to stated responsibilities and fulfilling their duties is their primary concern."
ESTJ,"They are also well-known for their loyalty and dedication, but in some ways this is contingent on their respect. People with this personality type are willing to voice their opinions, especially in deciding what is and is not acceptable – if provided with sensible responses that address their concerns, they are often satisfied with that. If They view their managers as illogical, dishonest or cowardly in their methods, they can be uncomfortably honest, if still calm and level, in voicing their opinions on that as well."
ESTJ,"They enjoy the hustle and bustle of well-organized workplaces. Honest, friendly and down-to-earth, XXXX personalities are great networkers who enjoy connecting with others to get things done. Abusing this for advancement is unlikely, and is in fact something They frown upon. Shortcuts are irresponsible, and people with the XXXX personality type lose respect quickly for those who try to push forward by showing off or promoting bold but risky ideas, making relationships with more inspiration-oriented colleagues a challenge."
ESTJ,"They like to feel like they are a part of the team, and a part of the greater organization that they work for. To make sure this happens, They are nearly always willing to accept criticism that can help to improve their effectiveness, and always keep an eye on their surroundings to make sure they and their team deliver the results that are expected of them."
ESTJ,"They take genuine pleasure in organizing others into effective teams, and as managers they have no better opportunity to do so. While sometimes overbearing, even micromanaging, They’ strong wills also serve to defend their teams and principles against diversions and cutbacks, regardless of who brings them. Laziness and bad work ethic are not tolerated by They under any circumstances."
ESTJ,"They project natural authority, but they sometimes expect this authority to be abided unconditionally, resisting change and demanding that things be done by the book. Whether They’ own book or the existing rules and traditions are used is subject to circumstances, but they do tend to rest on the security of tradition and precedent. Regardless, They’ expectations are clearly expressed, leaving little room or tolerance for deviation from the agenda."
ESTJ,"Few personality types are as practical and strong-willed as They. Known for their reliability and administrative skills, They are good at creating and maintaining a secure and stable environment for themselves and their loved ones. They’ dedication is invaluable in many areas, including their own personal growth."
ESFJ,"XXXX (XXXX) is a person with the Extraverted, Observant, Feeling, and Judging personality traits. They are attentive and people-focused, and they enjoy taking part in their social community. Their achievements are guided by decisive values, and they willingly offer guidance to others."
ESFJ,"People who share the XXXX personality type are, for lack of a better word, popular – which makes sense, given that it is also a very common personality type, making up twelve percent of the population. In high school, They are the cheerleaders and the quarterbacks, setting the tone, taking the spotlight and leading their teams forward to victory and fame. Later in life, They continue to enjoy supporting their friends and loved ones, organizing social gatherings and doing their best to make sure everyone is happy."
ESFJ,"Discussing scientific theories or debating European politics isn’t likely to capture They’ interest for too long. They are more concerned with fashion and their appearance, their social status and the standings of other people. Practical matters and gossip are their bread and butter, but They do their best to use their powers for good."
ESFJ,"They are altruists, and they take seriously their responsibility to help and to do the right thing. Unlike their Diplomat relatives however, people with the XXXX personality type will base their moral compass on established traditions and laws, upholding authority and rules, rather than drawing their morality from philosophy or mysticism. It’s important for They to remember though, that people come from many backgrounds and perspectives, and what may seem right to them isn’t always an absolute truth."
ESFJ,"They love to be of service, enjoying any role that allows them to participate in a meaningful way, so long as they know that they are valued and appreciated. This is especially apparent at home, and They make loyal and devoted partners and parents. XXXX personalities respect hierarchy, and do their best to position themselves with some authority, at home and at work, which allows them to keep things clear, stable and organized for everyone."
ESFJ,"Supportive and outgoing, They can always be spotted at a party – they’re the ones finding time to chat and laugh with everyone! But their devotion goes further than just breezing through because they have to. They truly enjoy hearing about their friends’ relationships and activities, remembering little details and always standing ready to talk things out with warmth and sensitivity. If things aren’t going right, or there’s tension in the room, They pick up on it and to try to restore harmony and stability to the group."
ESFJ,"Being pretty conflict-averse, They spend a lot of their energy establishing social order, and prefer plans and organized events to open-ended activities or spontaneous get-togethers. People with this personality type put a lot of effort into the activities they’ve arranged, and it’s easy for They’ feelings to be hurt if their ideas are rejected, or if people just aren’t interested. Again, it’s important for They to remember that everyone is coming from a different place, and that disinterest isn’t a comment about them or the activity they’ve organized – it’s just not their thing."
ESFJ,"Coming to terms with their sensitivity is They’ biggest challenge – people are going to disagree and they’re going to criticize, and while it hurts, it’s just a part of life. The best thing for They to do is to do what they do best: be a role model, take care of what they have the power to take care of, and enjoy that so many people do appreciate the efforts they make.. Strong Practical Skills – They are excellent managers of day-to-day tasks and routine maintenance, enjoying making sure that those who are close to them are well cared for.. Strong Sense of Duty – People with the XXXX personality type have a strong sense of responsibility and strive to meet their obligations, though this may sometimes be more from a sense of social expectations than intrinsic drive.. Very Loyal – Valuing stability and security very highly, They are eager to preserve the status quo, which makes them extremely loyal and trustworthy partners and employees. They are true pillars of any groups they belong to – whether it is their family or a community club, people with this personality type can always be relied upon.. Sensitive and Warm – Helping to ensure that stability, XXXX personalities seek harmony and care deeply about other people’s feelings, being careful not to offend or hurt anybody. They are strong team players, and win-win situations are the stuff smiles are made of.. Good at Connecting with Others – These qualities come together to make They social, comfortable and well-liked. XXXX personalities have a strong need to “belong”, and have no problem with small talk or following social cues in order to help them take an active role in their communities."
ESFJ,"Worried about Their Social Status – These Strengths are related to a chief Weakness: They’ preoccupation with social status and influence, which affects many decisions they make, potentially limiting their creativity and open-mindedness.. Inflexible – They place a lot of importance on what is socially acceptable, and can be very cautious, even critical of anything unconventional or outside the mainstream. People with this personality type may also sometimes push their own beliefs too hard in an effort to establish them as mainstream.. Reluctant to Innovate or Improvise – Just as they can be critical of others’ “unusual” behavior, They may also be unwilling to step out of their own comfort zones, usually for fear of being (or just appearing) different.. Vulnerable to Criticism – It can be especially challenging to change these tendencies because They are so conflict-averse. XXXX personalities can become very defensive and hurt if someone, especially a person close to them, criticizes their habits, beliefs or traditions.. Often Too Needy – They need to hear and see a great deal of appreciation. If their efforts go unnoticed, people with the XXXX personality type may start fishing for compliments, in an attempt to get reassurance of how much they are valued.. Too Selfless – The other side of this is that They sometimes try to establish their value with doting attention, something that can quickly overwhelm those who don’t need it, making it ultimately unwelcome. Furthermore, They often neglect their own needs in the process."
ESFJ,"Prizing social validation and a sense of belonging so highly, romantic relationships hold a special level of importance for They. No other kind of relationship provides people with the XXXX personality type with the same level of support and devotion, and the feelings of security and stability that come with strong romantic relationships are extremely warming."
ESFJ,"With such a goal in mind, XXXX personalities take each stage, from dating to everything thereafter, very seriously. Everything about They’ relationships is based on satisfying mutual needs, from creating understanding early on to building mutual respect and support for each other’s opinions and goals. Knowing that they are loved and appreciated has a huge effect on They’ mood and self-esteem."
ESFJ,"If they feel like this support isn’t there, such as when their partners deliver criticism, They can feel extremely hurt. People with the XXXX personality type dislike conflict and criticism, which can make it challenging to address any problems that come up. Nothing is more hurtful or depressing to They than to realize that their partners don’t respect their dreams or opinions. They can be surprisingly tough and tireless in the face of hardship, but they need to know without a doubt that their partners are behind them 100%."
ESFJ,"Unfortunately, less mature They may lack the inner strength and wisdom to attract this in healthy ways. They can be very needy, compromising their own principles and values in exchange for their partners’ approval. This is a terrible trap – not only is it unattractive, it can too easily lead to emotionally abusive relationships, which reduce They’ self-esteem further. Another snare is their fixation on social status and approval – it’s not uncommon for They’ social circles and relatives to play a bigger part in their choice of dating partners than even their own values."
ESFJ,"They are warm, loyal people who want to feel trusted and valued. They are great with practical matters like money management and administrative tasks, and are happy to take on such responsibilities in the name of taking care of the people they care about, a wonderful quality. They just need to make sure they take the time to ensure that they build relationships that allow them to satisfy their own needs and dreams, with partners who appreciate their care and generosity fully, and who reciprocate as well."
ESFJ,"They are often very organized in how their relationships develop, following established dating rules and traditions (don’t call first, third date, etc.). As their relationships enter more sexual stages, They’ emphasis on process and tradition continue with established gender roles and socially acceptable activities."
ESFJ,"However, since They are so centered on the physical world and are quite emotional, they tend to be very affectionate and sensual, and overall great sexual partners. People with this personality type love to find ways to make their partners happy, and this sort of intimacy is a great way to do so. As the two partners become more comfortable with each other, They are often open to experimenting and trying new things, so long as their partners are willing to reciprocate."
ESFJ,"They have specific needs for their relationships, and certain personality types are best able to meet those needs. In general, partners should share They’ Observant (S) trait, but it can also be useful to develop a sense of introspection that Introverted (I) partners can provide, with maybe one more opposing trait to help They focus on logical decisions when appropriate, or to be more open-minded in new situations."
ESFJ,"They are a very social personality type, seeking large circles of friends and proving themselves more than willing to spend the time and energy necessary to maintain these relationships. Loyal and warm, They are known for standing by their friends no matter what, and providing a constant source of emotional support and encouragement."
ESFJ,"Doing everything they can to make sure their friends are happy, and being so comfortable with introductions and small talk, They are naturally very popular in pretty much any environment. This is a dynamic that They genuinely enjoy, but they also expect their efforts and support to be reciprocated. There’s nothing quite as hurtful to people with the XXXX personality type as finding out that a trusted friend is critical of their beliefs or habits, except maybe being told so in a direct confrontation."
ESFJ,"They have a tendency to believe that their friends can do no wrong, always stepping up to defend them regardless of circumstances, and they expect the same benefit of the doubt in return. They can greatly expand their circle of friends if they learn to be more receptive to other perspectives, rather than making snap judgments and conclusions. It’s important for They, as with anyone, to avoid being insulated from other viewpoints and opinions, to relate to and understand ever more people."
ESFJ,"On the other hand, They are great at using their sensitivity to stay in tune with what motivates and drives their friends. While in their weaker moments, XXXX personalities can sometimes use these observations to manipulate others, they are far more interested in maintaining strong relationships, and this is a great tool for doing so. Altruists that they are, They almost always use their powers for good, encouraging and inspiring others."
ESFJ,"By and large, the XXXX personality type is a pleasant and sincere one. Their energy and social intelligence win them many acquaintances and friends, and their support and dedication keep those friendships close and strong. With so much zest for life and company, dull moments are sure to be few and far between."
ESFJ,"As parents, They have an excellent opportunity to display their warmth, affection and dedication in ways that have a real and positive impact. Sensitive yet firm, XXXX parents are able to establish rules and authority without being entirely overbearing, using their compassion and support to smooth over the occasional miscommunication or difference of opinion."
ESFJ,"From the start, They try to ensure that their children feel safe and happy. People with the XXXX personality type enjoy the support they are able to give their infants, who are utterly dependent on their care. Family being as important as it is to They, this is an incredibly rewarding start to the relationship."
ESFJ,"As their children grow and begin to explore more, They’ love and care grows with them, but often becomes overprotective. They may not just keep their children safe physically, but also socially, by arranging play dates, camps and other activities so much that their children aren’t free to make the blunders that lead to emotional growth and social independence."
ESFJ,"They value harmony and stability highly, and it’s often the case that they try to use indirect pressure to try to teach life’s lessons. When they are forced into a confrontation by their children’s blatant wrong-doing though, XXXX parents step in firmly, and expect their words to be respected. Believers in traditional roles, XXXX parents view the parent-child relationship in black and white terms, with their authority as final."
ESFJ,"As their children grow into adolescence and begin to push away from their parents, They can take this transition personally. Feeling like they are losing their children, XXXX personalities sometimes try to prolong their dependence as long as possible. It’s important to remember that when grown children leave the home, it’s because their parents were successful in preparing them for the next phase of their lives, an accomplishment They can be proud of."
ESFJ,"They’ children will always appreciate the sensitivity and warmth that they were raised with, and as time goes on and they have their own children, they will cherish the fact that those children have the benefit of grandparents who love and care for them unconditionally."
ESFJ,"Because They’ traits are so strongly expressed, leading with practical sense and social vigor, the careers they find most satisfying usually revolve around making the best use of these qualities. They are well-organized, enjoying bringing order and structure to their workplaces, and often work best in environments with clear, predictable hierarchies and tasks. Monotony and routine work are not a challenge for the XXXX personality type, as they are happy to do what needs to be done."
ESFJ,"Careers as administrators are a natural fit, allowing They to organize not just an environment, but the people in it. Their practical skills combine well with their dependability, making XXXX personalities surprisingly good accountants – though they often prefer to be personal accountants, helping people and interacting with them directly, instead of corporate accountants crunching numbers in some back room."
ESFJ,"Purely analytical careers are often too dull for They though – they need human interaction and emotional feedback to be truly satisfied in their line of work. Good listeners and enthusiastic team members, people with the XXXX personality type are excellent providers of medical care and social work. Teaching is another great option, as They are comfortable with authority, but are supportive and friendly enough to keep that authority from feeling overbearing."
ESFJ,"Being as altruistic as they are, They find it hard to be satisfied unless they know they’ve done something valuable for another person. This is often the driving force behind They’ careers and career advancement, and makes religious work and counseling particularly rewarding."
ESFJ,"Whatever they choose to do, XXXX personalities’ comfort with busy social situations and practical knowledge and skills come together to create people who are not just able to be productive and helpful, but people who genuinely enjoy it."
ESFJ,"When it comes to the workplace, They have clear tendencies that show through regardless of their position. People with the XXXX personality type thrive on social order and harmony, and use their warmth and social intelligence to make sure that each person knows their responsibilities and is able to get done what needs to get done. They are comfortable, even dependent on clear hierarchies and roles, and whether subordinates, colleagues or managers, XXXX personalities expect authority to be respected and backed up by rules and standards."
ESFJ,"With clearly defined responsibilities and a sense of purpose, They are patient, efficient, hard-working people who respect the authority of their managers. While They may struggle with too much freedom and improvisation, they thrive in workplaces with structure, safety and guidelines. Routine tasks are not a problem for They, and their dedication and loyalty earn them the respect of their managers."
ESFJ,"Teamwork is a concept that They have no trouble putting into practice. Often seeking friends at work, people with this personality type are almost always willing to lend a hand when and where it’s needed. Excellent networkers, They always seem to “know just the guy” to bring a project together on time. On the other hand, They often need to work on a team – being stuck alone chipping away at paperwork for days on end just leaves them tired and unfulfilled."
ESFJ,"They take pride in these qualities, which has the side effect of making them particularly sensitive when they come under criticism. When their suggestions and help are turned down, XXXX personalities can take it personally. Already somewhat vulnerable to stress, rejections like these can be pretty demoralizing, and They may need their coworkers to make an effort to express their appreciation from time to time."
ESFJ,"They enjoy the responsibility that comes with organizing social situations, and the enjoyment they feel in managing other people translates well into management positions. As team leaders, They find ways to make everyone feel involved, uniting people and smoothing relations in order to get things done."
ESFJ,"At the same time, They have a strong respect for traditional power structures, and if after all their efforts convincing their subordinates to work together someone ends up challenging their authority, they can stress out, lose their temper, and just generally react badly. People with the XXXX personality type are sensitive about their status and dislike conflict, and prefer situations where everyone knows their role. So long as expectations are clearly outlined, They are effective and enjoyable managers."
ESFJ,"Few personality types are as practical and caring as They. Known for their social and administrative skills, They are good at creating and maintaining a secure, stable and friendly environment for themselves and their loved ones. They’ dedication is invaluable in many areas, including their own personal growth."
ISTP,"XXXX (XXXX) is someone with the Introverted, Observant, Thinking, and Prospecting personality traits. They tend to have an individualistic mindset, pursuing goals without needing much external connection. They engage in life with inquisitiveness and personal skill, varying their approach as needed."
ISTP,"They love to explore with their hands and their eyes, touching and examining the world around them with cool rationalism and spirited curiosity. People with this personality type are natural Makers, moving from project to project, building the useful and the superfluous for the fun of it, and learning from their environment as they go. Often mechanics and engineers, They find no greater joy than in getting their hands dirty pulling things apart and putting them back together, just a little bit better than they were before."
ISTP,"They explore ideas through creating, troubleshooting, trial and error and first-hand experience. They enjoy having other people take an interest in their projects and sometimes don’t even mind them getting into their space. Of course, that’s on the condition that those people don’t interfere with They’ principles and freedom, and they’ll need to be open to They returning the interest in kind."
ISTP,"They enjoy lending a hand and sharing their experience, especially with the people they care about, and it’s a shame they’re so uncommon, making up only about five percent of the population. XXXX women are especially rare, and the typical gender roles that society tends to expect can be a poor fit – they’ll often be seen as tomboys from a young age."
ISTP,"While their mechanical tendencies can make them appear simple at a glance, They are actually quite enigmatic. Friendly but very private, calm but suddenly spontaneous, extremely curious but unable to stay focused on formal studies, XXXX personalities can be a challenge to predict, even by their friends and loved ones. They can seem very loyal and steady for a while, but they tend to build up a store of impulsive energy that explodes without warning, taking their interests in bold new directions."
ISTP,"They’ decisions stem from a sense of practical realism, and at their heart is a strong sense of direct fairness, a “do unto others” attitude, which really helps to explain many of They’ puzzling traits. Instead of being overly cautious though, avoiding stepping on toes in order to avoid having their toes stepped on, They are likely to go too far, accepting likewise retaliation, good or bad, as fair play."
ISTP,"The biggest issue They are likely to face is that they often act too soon, taking for granted their permissive nature and assuming that others are the same. They’ll be the first to tell an insensitive joke, get overly involved in someone else’s project, roughhouse and play around, or suddenly change their plans because something more interesting came up."
ISTP,"They will come to learn that many other personality types have much more firmly drawn lines on rules and acceptable behavior than they do – they don’t want to hear an insensitive joke, and certainly wouldn’t tell one back, and they wouldn’t want to engage in horseplay, even with a willing party. If a situation is already emotionally charged, violating these boundaries can backfire tremendously."
ISTP,"They have a particular difficulty in predicting emotions, but this is just a natural extension of their fairness, given how difficult it is to gauge They’ emotions and motivations. However, their tendency to explore their relationships through their actions rather than through empathy can lead to some very frustrating situations. People with the XXXX personality type struggle with boundaries and guidelines, preferring the freedom to move about and color outside the lines if they need to."
ISTP,"Finding an environment where they can work with good friends who understand their style and unpredictability, combining their creativity, sense of humor and hands-on approach to build practical solutions and things, will give They many happy years of building useful boxes – and admiring them from the outside.. Optimistic and Energetic – They are usually up to their elbows in some project or other. Cheerful and good-natured, people with the XXXX personality type (especially Assertive ones) rarely get stressed out, preferring to go with the flow.. Creative and Practical – They are very imaginative when it comes to practical things, mechanics, and crafts. Novel ideas come easily, and they love using their hands to put them into action.. Spontaneous and Rational – Combining spontaneity with logic, They can switch mindsets to fit new situations with little effort, making them flexible and versatile individuals.. Know How to Prioritize – This flexibility comes with some unpredictability, but XXXX personalities are able to store their spontaneity for a rainy day, releasing their energy just when it’s needed most.. Great in a Crisis – With all this hands-on creativity and spontaneity, it’s no wonder that They are naturals in crisis situations. People with this personality type usually enjoy a little physical risk, and they aren’t afraid to get their hands dirty when the situation calls for it.. Relaxed – Through all this, They are able to stay quite relaxed. They live in the moment and go with the flow, refusing to worry too much about the future."
ISTP,"Stubborn – As easily as They go with the flow, they can also ignore it entirely, and usually move in another direction with little apology or sensitivity. If someone tries to change They’ habits, lifestyle or ideas through criticism, they can become quite blunt in their irritation.. Insensitive – They use logic, and even when they try to meet others halfway with empathy and emotional sensitivity, it rarely seems to quite come out right, if anything is even said at all.. Private and Reserved – XXXX personalities are notoriously difficult to get to know. They are true introverts, keeping their personal matters to themselves, and often just prefer silence to small talk.. Easily Bored – They enjoy novelty, which makes them excellent tinkerers, but much less reliable when it comes to focusing on things long-term. Once something is understood, They tend to simply move on to something new and more interesting.. Dislike Commitment – Long-term commitments are particularly onerous for They. They prefer to take things day-by-day, and the feeling of being locked into something for a long time is downright oppressive. This can be a particular challenge in They’ romantic relationships.. Risky Behavior – This stubbornness, difficulty with others’ emotions, focus on the moment, and easy boredom can lead to unnecessary and unhelpful boundary-pushing, just for fun. They have been known to escalate conflict and danger just to see where it goes, something that can have disastrous consequences for everyone around if they lose control of the situation."
ISTP,"When it comes to romantic relationships with They, it’s a bit like nailing Jell-O to a tree. Dating XXXX personalities is a tango, complex and interesting, with alternating coldness and detachment, and passion, spontaneity and enjoyment of the moment. Nothing can be forced in XXXX relationships, but so long as they are given the space they need to be themselves, they will gladly enjoy the comforts of a steady partner for a lifetime."
ISTP,"Early in dating, people with the XXXX personality type can be especially flighty – they live in the present, always looking for new activities and experiences. If a potential partner doesn’t measure up, They have no real problem walking away. They also need a great deal of personal space, both physically and mentally, and any attempts to control them or forcibly schedule their activities only accelerates their departure."
ISTP,"On the other hand, They have no problem trying to change their partners’ habits, most likely with attempts to get them to loosen up a bit and relax and have fun. XXXX personalities are hardly strict or traditional when it comes to dating, and often try to introduce sex into their activities early on. Sensual individuals that they are, They make ready use of all of their senses, viewing intimacy as an art, a performance, and a source of pleasure."
ISTP,"As their relationships progress, They’ partners tend to find that intimacy is about the closest they get to open emotional expression. It’s not that They don’t have feelings – they actually run quite deep and strong – just that they conceal and protect them because they are unsure how to deal with them and express them. They have no trouble leaving something they think is mutually understood unsaid."
ISTP,"This applies in a broader sense in They’ relationships as well. Any attempts to push understood arrangements, even the relationships themselves, into open discussion in order to secure commitment, especially early on, are often met by They with something close to panic. Nothing is so acutely terrifying to They as knowing that there’s no way out. Every day is a new day, and They review their obligations from moment to moment."
ISTP,"None of this should be taken too personally by They’ partners – it’s just how their minds work. People with this personality type live in the present, in a world of physical activities that engage the senses, and they just need to know that they have the freedom to be passionate about something one day and indifferent the next, without being grilled on when they’re going to finish something, or why they’ve “suddenly changed their minds”."
ISTP,"At the same time, being a little more expressive and a little more comfortable with the idea of consistency and follow-through can go a long way in rounding out the XXXX personality type. The best partners usually share They’ Observant (S) trait, that interest in what the world is here and now, with one or two opposing traits to help them to explore a world that also involves other people and others’ expectations."
ISTP,"When it comes to friendships, They seem made for Bushnell’s Law of game design: Easy to learn, difficult to master. With their well-rounded and interesting array of hobbies, people with the XXXX personality type have no trouble at all making acquaintances to share their activities with. It’s getting beneath the surface to become They’ true friends that is the real challenge, leaving them with a lot of good will and friendly faces to call on, but only a few people who they feel truly understand them."
ISTP,"lot of this comes down to They simply not wanting to be bound to any particular person or activity. XXXX personalities live in the present, enjoying whatever life brings, and feel no real obligation to shift course on account of others’ plans. If friends don’t want to do what They are doing, then they are free to go do their own thing, and they’ll hang out some other time. Sometimes their shifts in attitude can catch their friends flat-footed, but They’ motto remains “everything can be changed”. Forcing them to constantly commit to scheduled activities is probably the quickest way to end these friendships."
ISTP,"As long as everyone keeps things relaxed and flexible though, They’ friendships can be rich and rewarding. People with this personality type are talented when it comes to using their senses, and usually enjoy a little competition. This makes They’ hobbies, especially the more physical activities like fishing and crafts, especially enjoyable with a little company, and they are usually the basis for their friendships. They’ interests are pretty diverse, so they should have no trouble coming up with exciting things to do."
ISTP,"XXXX personalities are also thoughtful, rational people. Being fairly creative individuals themselves, they often enjoy discussing new ideas – but in the end, the point of sharing those ideas needs to be to take action. Dreaming is well and good, but talk is cheap, and discussions on abstract or distant subjects like Eurasian politics can only hold They’ attention for so long before they decide to shift their focus to something they can do."
ISTP,"This makes friendships with Intuitive (N) types, who have a much less physical approach to life, challenging for They to maintain. With their enjoyment of firsthand experience, these personalities just feel more comfortable alongside other personality types with the Observant (S) trait. So long as they share a hobby, philosophical differences and contrasting world views really don’t matter too much – it’s what people do that matters to They."
ISTP,"They are unusually popular, almost in spite of themselves. Their open-mindedness, interesting hobbies and relaxed attitude are attractive to a remarkably broad range of personality types. With so many acquaintances, They are sure to strike up deeper friendships with at least a few."
ISTP,"When it comes to parenting, They give their children more freedom and opportunity to do whatever they want, within sensible limits of course, than any other personality type. It’s a big world out there, meant to be explored and experienced. Nothing is quite as perplexing to XXXX parents as their children sitting inside and watching television all day. Relaxed, open-minded and flexible, XXXX personalities expect their children to use their freedom wisely – that is, to exploit it in the name of exploration and experience."
ISTP,"Early in life, this attitude is tremendously beneficial for They’ children. At this age, every little thing is a miracle, to be explored with every sense. Blocks don’t just have distinct colors and shapes, but smells and tastes too, and this sort of sensory exploration is right up They’ alley. As their children learn their motor skills, people with the XXXX personality type are happy to stack those blocks right along with them. As their children grow and develop more complex abilities, They find joy in showing them how to use real tools to build real things."
ISTP,"If They’ growing children share their basic qualities of spontaneity and passion for physical activities, they are happy to accompany them on just about any activity, be it sports, hiking or hobby engineering. None of this is anything that gets forced on their children though. They see little need in imparting their principles and interests on their children, instead just enjoying that their children enjoy doing things."
ISTP,"Where XXXX parents struggle most, as with their other relationships, is in emotional bonding. Emotional control is something that children learn and adapt to over years, and comparatively unemotional They are often left at a loss for what to do in the meantime. They may just need to rely on a more able partner. Otherwise, it takes a great deal of conscious effort on their part to be able to provide the sort of emotional understanding and support their children need."
ISTP,"The XXXX personality type is probably the hardest to pin down in many aspects of life, but especially in their careers. They thrive on diversity and unpredictability, on wondering “what’s next?” every morning. This makes They one of the most mysterious personality types, but also one of the most versatile in the professional world."
ISTP,"They are born problem-solvers with an unwavering focus on practical solutions (though perhaps not always solutions to practical problems). No other type is quite as fascinated by how things work, how tools can be used, and how facts can be put together to create immediate and satisfying results. This combination of curiosity and hands-on vigor make people with the XXXX personality type excellent mechanics, engineers, graphic designers, and forensic scientists."
ISTP,"“Practical” is the word of the day. But it’s not the practicality of routine administration that They crave – they need variety and action, perhaps even a little adrenaline in their work. Highly structured environments leave XXXX personalities bored and tired. Jobs that focus on crisis response, such as firefighters, paramedics, detectives, pilots and police officers seem made for They."
ISTP,"Perhaps most important to They though, is the feeling that they aren’t stuck. The freedom to wander, the freedom to declare their own schedules, their own responsibilities, their own environments – nearly every other consideration pales by comparison to the need to avoid inflexible commitments and stodgy colleagues. While this can be a significant hurdle to overcome in traditional employment, it is the chiefest allure of entrepreneurship."
ISTP,"Nearly any creative or constructive skill or interest can be offered on a freelance basis or on a business-owner’s own terms, be it blogger, systems analyst, athlete or driver. They need to face down their weak long-term planning abilities and preference for instant results in order to make this path work, but livelihoods can be made selling bits and crafts in their free time. It’s also possible to find more traditional work to satisfy these needs, and forest ranger is a sought-after line of work for many They."
ISTP,"They have a natural skill with troubleshooting, a relaxed, self-confident nature and a results-oriented focus. People with this personality type understand that risk equals reward, and as long as they can use that understanding with maturity, rather than just kicking the ant’s nest whenever they get bored, they are highly desirable in any dynamic field or environment."
ISTP,"When it comes to the workplace, They’ top requirement is often a sense of unpredictability and excitement. This quality makes XXXX personalities’ personal relationships challenging enough, even among close friends and immediate family – for those they’ve only come to know in a professional environment, it can be downright frustrating."
ISTP,"Of course, this all comes down to knowing what makes them tick. With a little space and a hands-on problem to solve, They can be some of the most productive people around. As with anyone, forcing people with the XXXX personality type into a mold that doesn’t fit just doesn’t work. Recognizing their unique perspective and gifts can lead to extraordinary results."
ISTP,"As subordinates, what They crave most is a little wiggle room. Relaxed and easy-going, people with the XXXX personality type are happy to stick around with surprising loyalty, as long as their employers and managers don’t try to force them to commit to anything that can’t be undone the next day. Strict rules, guidelines and formal agreements make They feel cramped and bored. If their habits or methods come under criticism or are forced to change, They can also be surprisingly mulish."
ISTP,"Something that’s likely to make They’ day is a random list of things that need to be fixed or dealt with. XXXX personalities have a talent for conserving their energy for just such an occasion, and can tackle such a laundry list with surprising enthusiasm. Their tasks do need to be hands-on though – if the items all start with “Come up with a strategy to...”, it’s probably better to find an Analyst type."
ISTP,"They are often much more liked by their colleagues than they would expect. Quiet and reserved, people with this personality type usually need a little physical space, but at the same time enjoy peeking in on others’ work to see if there’s anything interesting going on. Not naturally emotional or empathetic, They have a blunt way of communicating that can lead to misunderstandings or hurt feelings."
ISTP,"Yet, They combine this rationalism and reserve with a sense of spontaneity that, among other things, creates a lighthearted sense of “do unto others” fairness. Turnabout is always fair play, and the odd prank, and the retaliation, are usually enjoyed by all. They have a great sense of humor, if sometimes a little risqué, and are not only resistant to workplace conflicts, but are great at defusing them with a well-placed joke that puts it all into perspective."
ISTP,"XXXX managers treat their subordinates as they’d like to be treated: with minimal talking and loose boundaries. They aren’t big on chattiness or emotional expression, and more sensitive types may see them as cold and distant – effusive praise and back-slapping just isn’t in They’ nature. In fact, there isn’t likely to be a lot of feedback at all from XXXX managers, good or bad. But when problems do arise, they are great listeners who devise practical, fair, and impartial solutions."
ISTP,"Few personality types are as bold and practical as They. Known for their technical mastery and willingness to improvise, They are good at finding unique solutions to seemingly impossible challenges. They’ desire to explore and learn new things is invaluable in many areas, including their own personal growth."
ISFP,"An XXXX (XXXX) is a person with the Introverted, Observant, Feeling, and Prospecting personality traits. They tend to have open minds, approaching life, new experiences, and people with grounded warmth. Their ability to stay in the moment helps them uncover exciting potentials."
ISFP,"XXXX personalities are true artists, but not necessarily in the typical sense where they’re out painting happy little trees. Often enough though, they are perfectly capable of this. Rather, it’s that they use aesthetics, design and even their choices and actions to push the limits of social convention. They enjoy upsetting traditional expectations with experiments in beauty and behavior – chances are, they’ve expressed more than once the phrase “Don’t box me in!”"
ISFP,"They live in a colorful, sensual world, inspired by connections with people and ideas. These personalities take joy in reinterpreting these connections, reinventing and experimenting with both themselves and new perspectives. No other type explores and experiments in this way more. This creates a sense of spontaneity, making They seem unpredictable, even to their close friends and loved ones."
ISFP,"Despite all this, They are definitely Introverts, surprising their friends further when they step out of the spotlight to be by themselves to recharge. Just because they are alone though, doesn’t mean people with the XXXX personality type sit idle – they take this time for introspection, assessing their principles. Rather than dwelling on the past or the future, They think about who they are. They return from their cloister, transformed."
ISFP,"They live to find ways to push their passions. Riskier behaviors like gambling and extreme sports are more common with this personality type than with others. Fortunately their attunement to the moment and their environment allows them to do better than most. They also enjoy connecting with others, and have a certain irresistible charm."
ISFP,"However, if a criticism does get through, it can end poorly. Some They can handle kindly phrased commentary, valuing it as another perspective to help push their passions in new directions. But if the comments are more biting and less mature, XXXX personalities can lose their tempers in spectacular fashion."
ISFP,"They are sensitive to others’ feelings and value harmony. When faced with criticism, it can be a challenge for people with this type to step away from the moment long enough to not get caught up in the heat of the moment. But living in the moment goes both ways, and once the heightened emotions of an argument cool, They can usually call the past the past and move on as though it never occurred."
ISFP,"The biggest challenge facing They is planning for the future. Finding constructive ideals to base their goals on and working out goals that create positive principles is no small task. They don’t plan their futures in terms of assets and retirement. Rather, they plan actions and behaviors as contributions to a sense of identity, building a portfolio of experiences, not stocks."
ISFP,"If these goals and principles are noble, They can act with amazing charity and selflessness – but it can also happen that people with the XXXX personality type establish a more self-centered identity, acting with selfishness, manipulation and egoism. It’s important for They to remember to actively become the person they want to be. Developing and maintaining a new habit may not come naturally, but taking the time each day to understand their motivations allows They to use their strengths to pursue whatever they’ve come to love.. Charming – People with the XXXX personality type are relaxed and warm, and their “live and let live” attitude naturally makes them likable and popular.. Sensitive to Others – They easily relate to others’ emotions, helping them to establish harmony and good will, and minimize conflict.. Imaginative – Being so aware of others’ emotions, XXXX personalities use creativity and insight to craft bold ideas that speak to people’s hearts. While it’s hard to explain this quality on a resume, this vivid imagination and exploratory spirit help They in unexpected ways.. Passionate – Beneath They’ quiet shyness beats an intensely feeling heart. When people with this personality type are caught up in something exciting and interesting, they can leave everything else in the dust.. Curious – Ideas are well and good, but They need to see and explore for themselves whether their ideas ring true. Work revolving around the sciences may seem a poor match for their traits, but a boldly artistic and humanistic vision is often exactly what research needs to move forward – if They are given the freedom they need to do so.. Artistic – They are able to show their creativity in tangible ways and with stunning beauty. Whether writing a song, painting an emotion, or presenting a statistic in a graph, They have a way of visualizing things that resonates with their audience."
ISFP,"Fiercely Independent – Freedom of expression is often They’ top priority. Anything that interferes with that, like traditions and hard rules, creates a sense of oppression for XXXX personalities. This can make more rigidly structured academics and work a challenge.. Unpredictable – They’ dislike long-term commitments and plans. The tendency to actively avoid planning for the future can cause strain in They’ romantic relationships and financial hardship later in life.. Easily Stressed – They live in the present, full of emotion. When situations get out of control, people with this personality type (especially Turbulent ones) can shut down, losing their characteristic charm and creativity in favor of gnashing teeth.. Overly Competitive – They can escalate small things into intense competitions, turning down long-term success in their search for glory in the moment, and are unhappy when they lose.. Fluctuating Self-Esteem – It’s demanded that skills be quantified, but that’s hard to do with They’ strengths of sensitivity and artistry. They’ efforts are often dismissed, a hurtful and damaging blow, especially early in life. They can start to believe the naysayers without strong support."
ISFP,"They are quite mysterious and difficult to get to know. While very emotional individuals, they guard this sensitive core carefully, preferring to listen than to express. People with the XXXX personality type focus instead on their partners, with little interest in dictating the mood of a situation with their own feelings. While this can sometimes be frustrating, if they are accepted for who they are, They prove to be warm, enthusiastic partners."
ISFP,"As their relationships grow, They’ partners come to find vibrancy and spontaneity to be par for the course. They may not be great long-term planners, preferring to let their partners take the lead when it comes to logic and strategy, but they almost never run out of things to do in the present. Also caring and loyal, They love finding ways to surprise their partners in fun little ways."
ISFP,"There’s also a sense of practicality to They’ unpredictability – if anyone is going to cancel a planned trip to stay home with a partner who suddenly got the flu as a gesture of affection, it is XXXX personalities. Spending time with their partners is something They really enjoy, and they want their partners to know that they are cared for and special."
ISFP,"It’s important for their partners to make it clear that this love and attention is valued. They would never ask for such thanks, but it can really hurt their feelings if they don’t hear it. Such expressions don’t have to be verbal – They believe in actions, not words – but it’s crucial that they know their feelings are shared. On the other side of the spectrum, there are few types more vulnerable to criticism and conflict, and it’s necessary to provide a certain level of emotional support."
ISFP,"If they do feel appreciated, They are more than happy to reciprocate in any way they know how. People with the XXXX personality type are very sensual, and in no aspect of their lives is this clearer than in their sex lives. Intimacy is an opportunity for They to satisfy their partners, and they involve every sense available in enjoying these moments. They may be shy in public, but alone with a partner they trust, the masks come off – few people get to see this side, and it’s always a pleasant surprise."
ISFP,"Feelings and emotions underpin every aspect of They’ relationships, alongside not just a tendency towards, but a need for, fresh possibilities. XXXX personalities are not to be forced into anything, and rushing long-term commitments is a sure way to scare them off. If They can’t feel excited in wondering “what’s next?” every morning, they may find themselves wondering “what’s the point?”"
ISFP,"Still, developing some skill with planning can be a healthy area of growth for They. Learning to be a little more comfortable with voicing their feelings and communicating more clearly is something their partners can also help with. In any case, sharing the Observant (S) trait usually smooths out the more challenging aspects of mutual understanding, and relationships with people who have the Extraverted (E) and Judging (J) traits helps They to learn and grow in real, attainable ways."
ISFP,"In friendship, They are some of the most comfortable people around. Laid back and spontaneous, people with the XXXX personality type won’t bog things down with arguments or structured long-term plans. Intellectually exhausting pastimes like debates over European economic policy won’t hold their attention long. The here-and-now is what’s important to They, and they love spending time with their friends doing casual, fun activities."
ISFP,"XXXX personalities believe in actions, not words. They talk about what is, not what could, should or will be, and then they actually do it. This passion for action is a blessing for They, since it helps them get past their shyness in meeting new people. They are sensitive, much more so than most, and it takes time to build enough trust with new friends to open up and feel natural."
ISFP,"If new acquaintances start things out by explaining “You’d do way better if...”, it’s unlikely they will ever be close – They just take these remarks too personally for comfort. People with this personality type are happy to get along with just about anyone, but potential friends need to ease up on being too judgmental or demanding."
ISFP,"If their friends keep things supportive and easy-going, They are happy to return the favor with added warmth and laughter. When they’re with friends they trust, They know how to relax, shedding rules, traditions and expectations in favor of just enjoying themselves."
ISFP,"Those who prefer safe, structured environments might end up struggling in these friendships though, especially if they lecture They on how they’re living their lives. As with any criticism, those friends are free to do their own thing, and to leave They to do theirs."
ISFP,"Lots of personal space and freedom are essential to XXXX personalities, and it’s often other Explorer types, who share their “live and let live” worldview and joy in actually doing things, that gravitate towards They. There’s really no better friend than They for dropping the pretenses and enjoying low-stress fun."
ISFP,"When it comes to parenting, They often feel right at home. While no one could be said to be truly prepared for such a task, XXXX personalities’ natural warmth, practicality and relaxed nature help them to settle in and appreciate every moment of joy and hardship that comes with raising a child."
ISFP,"They’ greatest strength is arguably the joy they take in being with and helping their loved ones. Practical needs are taken care of from day one, and They’ children can always count on something exciting to do or to learn every day. People with the XXXX personality type love fun, hands-on activities, and as their children grow, they’re often encouraged to pick up extra hobbies that revolve around those kinds of activities."
ISFP,"Even as those extra activities grow, They often defy their Introversion (I), spending time with their children and enjoying engaging activities that center on quality time. Impromptu trips, home improvement projects like repainting bedrooms, or simply baking some treats together are all likely to being fond memories for They’ children."
ISFP,"None of this is to say that XXXX parents are overbearing – in fact, they are one of the most relaxed personality types there is when it comes to parenting. They believe that the only way to really have their children grow up to be open-minded and well-balanced people is to let them explore and experience new things, make mistakes and learn from them, and to always know that they’ll be able to come home at the end of it."
ISFP,"The freedom They grant their children comes with risks too, since it demands a certain level of maturity from the children themselves. Some lessons are harder than others. These can be hard lessons for people with the XXXX personality type too, since they are more sensitive than most when it comes to their lifestyles or parenting being criticized. Nothing’s quite as unpleasant as “I told you so”."
ISFP,"Long-term planning is another challenging area for XXXX parents. When it comes to things like saving for their children’s college education, They necessarily rely on partners who take care of that sort of thing more readily."
ISFP,"As their children grow into adolescence, They sometimes struggle as well. XXXX personalities need to know that their work and effort are appreciated, something teenagers aren’t well-known for expressing. It can take a lot of practice on They’ parts to learn the emotional control necessary to not overreact when things don’t go the way they want. Children make an effort to distance themselves at that age, and private individuals or no, They need to know that their loved ones are by their sides."
ISFP,"In the end though, They are so much less likely to create the kinds of divides that other more rigid personality types sometimes drive between themselves and their children. There’s always going to be some push from developing adults, but with such warm, caring parents, They’ children can always rest assured that they know where home and hearth are."
ISFP,"When it comes to the career world, They need more than just a job. Wealth, power, structure, advancement and security are all lesser goals to XXXX personalities’ greatest need: creative freedom. They crave a tangible outlet for their imagination, a chance to express themselves artistically."
ISFP,"People with the XXXX personality type are passionate experimenters, and whether they’re aware of it or not, they are renowned trendsetters. With their unique perspective and simple desire to be themselves, They are natural artists, musicians and photographers, as well as designers of all stripes. Setting up shop on websites like Etsy is far more alluring to They than the confines of 9-5 administrative work in some fluorescent cubicle."
ISFP,"They loathe sitting idle in colorless, unchanging environments. They are free souls and need flexibility, opportunities for improvisation, and immersive work that engages every sense. If they combine these needs with their competitive nature, XXXX personalities make great solo athletes. They prefer to live in the moment, believing the here and now is what matters most."
ISFP,"This quality does have the drawback of sometimes making They reckless and shortsighted, though those pitfalls aren’t set in stone. An emphasis on practical, tangible things, objects that can be seen and touched, comes at the cost of ignoring less tangible ideas. They often feel that they have little control over processes like retirement planning – they can’t predict the future, so it does no good to worry about it now."
ISFP,"This mindset can hold them back from many of their ideal careers, such as psychology, counseling and teaching, which require long-term planning and often extensive certifications to get started. It takes a great deal of energy for They to maintain focus on a single goal like that for so long, but it can make the day-to-day so much more rewarding for the rest of their lives."
ISFP,"An easier route revolves around freelance and consulting work in just about any industry that They enjoy. Whether organizing charity events, working with hospitals to make patients’ stays more pleasant, or laying stone to help make a house a home, They always seem to find a way to make the world a little more beautiful and exciting, and to make a living in the process."
ISFP,"In the workplace, They seek out positions that give them as much wiggle room as possible to do things their own way. Button-down environments that revolve around tightly held traditions and strictly enforced procedures are unlikely to appeal to XXXX personalities. Spontaneous, charming, and genuinely fun people to be around, They just want a chance to express those natural qualities, and to know that their efforts are appreciated."
ISFP,"People with the XXXX personality type don’t like to be controlled, and this can be quite clear in subordinate positions – they loathe being micromanaged. At the same time, They aren’t well-known for their long-term focus, but rather their adaptability and spontaneity. They’ll use unconventional methods, sometimes risky ones, and existing rules are just someone else’s way of doing things. Still, They find a way to make things happen. To manage XXXX personalities successfully, there need to be clearly set goals, and otherwise an open sandbox."
ISFP,"If this balance can be made to work, They show themselves to be eager learners and passionate problem-solvers, especially if they get to deal one-on-one with other people or to tackle a problem solo. People with this personality type are humble, even shy, and unlikely to put themselves on the spot by volunteering their help. But They do love to feel appreciated, and if assigned a task, they work hard to earn that appreciation."
ISFP,"Among their peers They feel most comfortable. Working with equals and giving some advice in order to solve practical problems is right where XXXX personalities like to be. While they may exhaust themselves if their role requires an excessive amount of social interaction, they are otherwise quite charming and have excellent networking skills."
ISFP,"They are tolerant and friendly, and usually just do what needs to be done regardless of whether their colleagues pull their own weight. At the end of the day though, They are sensitive and need to know that these efforts are appreciated – a well-placed compliment goes a long way. They do let their personal goals affect their approach to their work, which can make them a little unpredictable, but this is balanced by their desire for harmony and willingness to find win-win solutions whenever possible."
ISFP,"The position that feels most unnatural to They is management. They are not a domineering personality type, and take no joy in exerting control over others, planning long-term goals, or disciplining unsatisfactory behavior. But just because it feels a little strange, doesn’t mean XXXX personalities aren’t good at it."
ISFP,"They’ sensitivity allows them to be great listeners, helping them to align their subordinates’ personal motivations with the task at hand. They also give their subordinates the freedom to do what needs to be done to solve what needs to be solved on any given day, and They are likely to dig into that work right alongside them. This gives XXXX managers a marked style of inspiration and cooperation, and they’re usually well-liked."
ISFP,"Few personality types are as colorful and charming as They. Known for their kindness and artistic skills, They are great at finding exciting new things to explore and experience. They’ creativity and down-to-earth attitude are invaluable in many areas, including their own personal growth."
ESTP,"An XXXX (XXXX) is someone with the Extraverted, Observant, Thinking, and Prospecting personality traits. They tend to be energetic and action-oriented, deftly navigating whatever is in front of them. They love uncovering life’s opportunities, whether socializing with others or in more personal pursuits."
ESTP,"They always have an impact on their immediate surroundings – the best way to spot them at a party is to look for the whirling eddy of people flitting about them as they move from group to group. Laughing and entertaining with a blunt and earthy humor, XXXX personalities love to be the center of attention. If an audience member is asked to come on stage, They volunteer – or volunteer a shy friend."
ESTP,"Theory, abstract concepts and plodding discussions about global issues and their implications don’t keep They interested for long. They keep their conversation energetic, with a good dose of intelligence, but they like to talk about what is – or better yet, to just go out and do it. They leap before they look, fixing their mistakes as they go, rather than sitting idle, preparing contingencies and escape clauses."
ESTP,"They are the likeliest personality type to make a lifestyle of risky behavior. They live in the moment and dive into the action – they are the eye of the storm. People with the XXXX personality type enjoy drama, passion, and pleasure, not for emotional thrills, but because it’s so stimulating to their logical minds. They are forced to make critical decisions based on factual, immediate reality in a process of rapid-fire rational stimulus response."
ESTP,"This makes school and other highly organized environments a challenge for They. It certainly isn’t because they aren’t smart, and they can do well, but the regimented, lecturing approach of formal education is just so far from the hands-on learning that They enjoy. It takes a great deal of maturity to see this process as a necessary means to an end, something that creates more exciting opportunities."
ESTP,"Also challenging is that to They, it makes more sense to use their own moral compass than someone else’s. Rules were made to be broken. This is a sentiment few high school instructors or corporate supervisors are likely to share, and can earn XXXX personalities a certain reputation. But if they minimize the trouble-making, harness their energy, and focus through the boring stuff, They are a force to be reckoned with."
ESTP,"With perhaps the most perceptive, unfiltered view of any type, They have a unique skill in noticing small changes. Whether a shift in facial expression, a new clothing style, or a broken habit, people with this personality type pick up on hidden thoughts and motives where most types would be lucky to pick up anything specific at all. They use these observations immediately, calling out the change and asking questions, often with little regard for sensitivity. They should remember that not everyone wants their secrets and decisions broadcast."
ESTP,"If They aren’t careful though, they may get too caught in the moment, take things too far, and run roughshod over more sensitive people, or forget to take care of their own health and safety. Making up only four percent of the population, there are just enough They out there to keep things spicy and competitive, and not so many as to cause a systemic risk."
ESTP,"They are full of passion and energy, complemented by a rational, if sometimes distracted, mind. Inspiring, convincing and colorful, they are natural group leaders, pulling everyone along the path less traveled, bringing life and excitement everywhere they go. Putting these qualities to a constructive and rewarding end is They’ true challenge.. Bold – People with the XXXX personality type are full of life and energy. There is no greater joy for They than pushing boundaries and discovering and using new things and ideas.. Rational and Practical – They love knowledge and philosophy, but not for their own sake. What’s fun for XXXX personalities is finding ideas that are actionable and drilling into the details so they can put them to use. If a discussion is completely arbitrary, there are better uses for They’ time.. Original – Combining their boldness and practicality, They love to experiment with new ideas and solutions. They put things together in ways no one else would think to.. Perceptive – This originality is helped by They’ ability to notice when things change – and when they need to change! Small shifts in habits and appearances stick out to They, and they use these observations to help create connections with others.. Direct – This perceptive skill isn’t used for mind games – They prefer to communicate clearly, with direct and factual questions and answers. Things are what they are.. Sociable – All these qualities pull together to make a natural group leader in They. This isn’t something that they actively seek – people with this personality type just have a knack for making excellent use of social interactions and networking opportunities."
ESTP,"Insensitive – Feelings and emotions come second to facts and “reality” for They. Emotionally charged situations are awkward, uncomfortable affairs, and They’ blunt honesty doesn’t help here. These personalities often have a lot of trouble acknowledging and expressing their own feelings as well.. Impatient – They move at their own pace to keep themselves excited. Slowing down because someone else “doesn’t get it” or having to stay focused on a single detail for too long is extremely challenging for They.. Risk-prone – This impatience can lead They to push into uncharted territory without thinking of the long-term consequences. XXXX personalities sometimes intentionally combat boredom with extra risk.. Unstructured – They see an opportunity – to fix a problem, to advance, to have fun – and seize the moment, often ignoring rules and social expectations in the process. This may get things done, but it can create unexpected social fallout.. May Miss the Bigger Picture – Living in the moment can cause They to miss the forest for the trees. People with this personality type love to solve problems here and now, perhaps too much. All parts of a project can be perfect, but the project will still fail if those parts do not fit together.. Defiant – They won’t be boxed in. Repetition, hardline rules, sitting quietly while they are lectured at – this isn’t how They live their lives. They are action-oriented and hands-on. Environments like school and much entry-level work can be so tedious that they’re intolerable, requiring extraordinary effort from They to stay focused long enough to get to freer positions."
ESTP,"When it comes to romantic relationships, people with the XXXX personality type can hardly be said to be pining away for their wedding day. Life is fun and full of surprises (something They have particular skill in delivering), and they enjoy it all in the here and now. They may not spend a lot of time planning for “someday”, but their enthusiasm and unpredictability make them thrilling dating partners."
ESTP,"They love new ideas and the occasional philosophical discussion – but they need to be topics that can explored through action together, not just idle talk. There’s musing about the causes and effects of epidemic obesity, and there’s training for a marathon together to promote healthy living."
ESTP,"Sexually, They have no real reservations. It’s fun, it’s physically enjoyable, new ideas are always welcome, and XXXX personalities’ strong perception keeps them well-tuned to their partners’ needs. However, They’ separation of the physical act from the more emotional and spiritual connections that many other types look for in intimacy can be a serious source of tension if everybody isn’t on the same page. Some types need sex to be a genuine expression of love – They just aren’t one of them."
ESTP,"As time passes, it can be challenging for They to move their relationships to deeper, more emotionally intimate levels. Easily bored, people with the XXXX personality type seek constant excitement – sometimes even intentionally exposing themselves to risk if they feel stuck. If their partners aren’t able to keep up, They may just end up looking for someone new. It’s not that XXXX personalities are unfaithful. Rather, they may think to themselves “This isn’t working, so why should I pretend it is?” They are rational, and can exercise self-control if they choose, but being as charming and popular as they are, it can sometimes be a little too easy to move on."
ESTP,"As with any relationship, it takes work and patience. Not every day can be a thrill a minute. But They are adaptable, curious individuals, which certainly helps to keep the flame burning. Maintaining healthy relationships is the ultimate chance for They to exercise their talents in perceiving every change in their partners’ mood and behavior, while also using their problem-solving abilities to address their needs. They can also strengthen more neglected traits, like emotional sensitivity and long-term planning."
ESTP,"People with the XXXX personality type are definitely the life of the party. With an enviable imagination and invigorating sense of spontaneity, They are never boring. They love exploring interesting ideas, both in discussion and by going out and seeing for themselves, which means that They always seem to have some fun activity hidden up their sleeves. At the same time, XXXX personalities are easy-going, tolerant, and charming, making them naturally quite popular."
ESTP,"Hands-on, physical activities like team sports are They’ idea of fun, and these environments give them plenty of chances to make new friends. There is little difficulty for They here – they seem to get along with just about everyone, and make new friends wherever they go. They live in the moment, and as a naturally confident personality type (especially if they are Assertive as well), they don’t worry much about what others think of them. This attracts friends who share their attitude and zest for life."
ESTP,"While not opposed to long philosophical discussions, and often enjoying the intellectual exercise, They are unlikely to develop friendships based solely around one-on-one discussions about European economic challenges and the role of religion in politics. Straightforward to the point of being blunt, They call it like they see it, and an honest opinion in debate is a sure thing. But at their hearts, They are people of action, preferring to do what can be done than to talk about what might someday be."
ESTP,"Exploration, excitement, adrenaline and risk – They’ friends should be prepared for all of these things. Often enough they’re happy to perform for the crowd, but they also tend to encourage their friends to join in. Most personality types might take “thanks but no thanks” personally, but They are comfortable with who they are, and are more likely to just shrug their shoulders and move on with those friends who are game for adventure."
ESTP,"In a lot of ways, They are what many children would consider the perfect parent. Fun-loving and playful, flexible and understanding, people with the XXXX personality type genuinely enjoy spending time with their children, and know how to make sure everyone is having a good time. They have a natural curiosity and spontaneity that is perfectly matched to the wonder and insatiable desire to learn that young children have."
ESTP,"They love hands-on activities, and their children aren’t left wanting for someone to play catch with, or to help them build a model for school. Sports, hiking, and other practical, hands-on hobbies are all welcomed and encouraged. At the same time, given their aversion to rules and schedules themselves, They aren’t likely to forcibly enter their children into all manner of clubs and teams. If their kids want to play softball, great – if not, well, they’ll just find something else to do."
ESTP,"They give their children freedom, encourage them to use their own judgment (especially with the minor stuff), and to follow their hearts – to heck with what other people think. XXXX personalities keep a close enough eye on their kids, using that knack for picking up on even the slightest changes in others’ moods and habits, that they can step in with extra guidance when things start to go wrong."
ESTP,"They do have one significant parental challenge though: emotional bonding. Feelings tend to be seen by They as a bit of an irrational distraction, rather than a tool for expression and connection. If their children happen to be more sensitive, this can be a source of tension between They and their children. Frank honesty isn’t always the best prescription."
ESTP,"Still, They can often rely on a more sensitive partner to help them out in this regard, and the healthy bonds they form through their shared activities can help to bridge the gap. They have the added benefit of direct and understanding relationships – their children won’t feel so much like they have to hide their mistakes and challenges, the holy grail of parent-child communication."
ESTP,"When it comes to They’ career options, “action” is the word of the day. People with the XXXX personality type think on their feet and are great at making quick decisions in the heat of the moment. At the same time, they’re affable people who always seem to make friends and connections wherever they go. Popularity and solid networking can be huge assets in the working world, and They nail it."
ESTP,"This social intelligence, combined with They’ natural boldness and improvisational skill, makes sales, business negotiations, marketing, even acting – any tense, competitive environment – a great fit. XXXX personalities trust themselves to make the right call. Risks, big and small, are a part of life, and They don’t sit around waiting for some boss at the top to tell them what to do. This can get They into trouble, but often enough it’s exactly what’s needed, and can boost them up the career ladder just as well."
ESTP,"Restrictions, rules, highly structured environments – these are great ways to drive They crazy. People with this personality type live life on their own terms, and this makes them brilliant business people and freelancers. These roles also allow them to delegate the more tedious aspects of work, the accounting, meticulous research and so forth, to those better suited."
ESTP,"They are curious, energetic people with a taste for action. There are those who analyze and manage the logistics of public safety resource distribution, and there are those who drive the ambulances, patrol the streets, and save lives with their own two hands – XXXX personalities are the latter. They are highly observant yet impatient, enabling them to take in the whole of a situation at a glance, and act. Any emergency response role is great for They, whether it be as paramedics, police officers, or soldiers."
ESTP,"This quality of living in the moment and craving immediate results for their efforts translates well into another field: sports. The thrill of competition, of pushing themselves to the physical limit to rack up just one more point for the win can have no comparison for They. Whether they are on the field as athletes themselves, coaching from the sidelines or commentating from high above, people with the XXXX personality type revel in well-honed team effort and a well-executed plan, and any of these positions makes a fine line of work for them."
ESTP,"In just about any environment, the workplace included, it’s pretty easy to spot They. Boisterous and spontaneous, fun-loving and maybe a little crass, people with the XXXX personality type love tackling problems as they arise and telling great stories about their solutions afterwards. Naturally, some positions work better with these qualities than others, but They are adaptable individuals, and can find a way to make just about any situation a little more interesting."
ESTP,"They’ most challenging position is the one that most people have to start out in: as subordinates. While perfectly capable of exercising restraint on their own terms, XXXX personalities hate having others’ rules and regulations foisted upon them. They are known for their experimentation, improvisation and quick thinking – if they’re not allowed to use these qualities and have to check in with a supervisor for every little thing, they’ll be bored and frustrated."
ESTP,"They know well that risk equals reward, and they’ll gladly skirt more mundane tasks in favor of something a little more exciting, in the hope that it catches someone’s attention. A plaque and a bonus go a long way for people with this personality type. Getting ahead by the tenets of staid reliability, quiet helpfulness, or mere seniority isn’t They’ way – they move forward by sheer force of personality in a well-handled crisis."
ESTP,"As colleagues, They have a work hard, play hard mentality – as long as everyone else is pulling their weight, they’ll gladly pull their own, and have a great time doing it. Charming and popular individuals that they are, networking comes naturally to They. These qualities make it easy for XXXX personalities to get along with just about anyone."
ESTP,"At the same time, if They see a colleague as incompetent, or worse, lazy, they let them know in no uncertain terms. Emotional sensitivity is not their strong suit. They are very observant and well-tuned to changes in their colleagues’ habits and moods – unless they themselves are the cause of distress."
ESTP,"Management positions are where They are usually most comfortable, as they often give the most flexibility. Rules and traditions are a bother for people with the XXXX personality type – they’d rather try a bunch of new ideas with a chance of getting things done faster or better than to pay attention to “the way things have always been done” or subordinates’ comfort with experimentation. They are practical, with a focus on what does, or could, work best."
ESTP,"This can make for a chaotic environment, but They’ inspiring cult of personality makes them well-suited to handling such a thing. They enjoy living in the moment. Rather than some broad, intangible future accomplishment like “making customers happy”, XXXX personalities set small, clear, measurable, and attainable goals that keep things on track day-to-day, and hearty congratulations can always be relied on for a job well done. They keep their eyes on the finish line, but they get there step by step."
ESTP,"Few personality types are as charming and attractive as They. Known for their ability to improvise and focus completely on the present, They are great at finding exciting new things to explore and experience. They’ creativity and down-to-earth attitude are invaluable in many areas, including their own personal growth."
ESFP,"An XXXX (XXXX) is a person with the Extraverted, Observant, Feeling, and Prospecting personality traits. These people love vibrant experiences, engaging in life eagerly and taking pleasure in discovering the unknown. They can be very social, often encouraging others into shared activities."
ESFP,"If anyone is to be found spontaneously breaking into song and dance, it is the XXXX personality type. They get caught up in the excitement of the moment, and want everyone else to feel that way, too. No other personality type is as generous with their time and energy as They when it comes to encouraging others, and no other personality type does it with such irresistible style."
ESFP,"They love the spotlight, and all the world’s a stage. Many famous people with the XXXX personality type are indeed actors, but they love putting on a show for their friends too, chatting with a unique and earthy wit, soaking up attention and making every outing feel a bit like a party. Utterly social, They enjoy the simplest things, and there’s no greater joy for them than just having fun with a good group of friends."
ESFP,"It’s not just talk either – They have the strongest aesthetic sense of any personality type. From grooming and outfits to a well-appointed home, XXXX personalities have an eye for fashion. Knowing what’s attractive the moment they see it, They aren’t afraid to change their surroundings to reflect their personal style. They are naturally curious, exploring new designs and styles with ease."
ESFP,"Though it may not always seem like it, They know that it’s not all about them – they are observant, and very sensitive to others’ emotions. People with this personality type are often the first to help someone talk out a challenging problem, happily providing emotional support and practical advice. However, if the problem is about them, They are more likely to avoid a conflict altogether than to address it head-on. They usually love a little drama and passion, but not so much when they are the focus of the criticisms it can bring."
ESFP,"The biggest challenge They face is that they are often so focused on immediate pleasures that they neglect the duties and responsibilities that make those luxuries possible. Complex analysis, repetitive tasks, and matching statistics to real consequences are not easy activities for They. They’d rather rely on luck or opportunity, or simply ask for help from their extensive circle of friends. It is important for They to challenge themselves to keep track of long-term things like their retirement plans or sugar intake – there won’t always be someone else around who can help to keep an eye on these things."
ESFP,"They recognize value and quality, which on its own is a fine trait. In combination with their tendency to be poor planners though, this can cause them to live beyond their means, and credit cards are especially dangerous. More focused on leaping at opportunities than in planning out long-term goals, They may find that their inattentiveness has made some activities unaffordable."
ESFP,"They are welcome wherever there’s a need for laughter, playfulness, and a volunteer to try something new and fun – and there’s no greater joy for XXXX personalities than to bring everyone else along for the ride. They can chat for hours, sometimes about anything but the topic they meant to talk about, and share their loved ones’ emotions through good times and bad. If they can just remember to keep their ducks in a row, they’ll always be ready to dive into all the new and exciting things the world has to offer, friends in tow.. Bold – They aren’t known for holding back. Wanting to experience everything there is to experience, people with the XXXX personality type don’t mind stepping out of their comfort zones when no one else is willing.. Original – Traditions and expectations are secondary to They, if a consideration at all. XXXX personalities love to experiment with new styles, and constantly find new ways to stick out in the crowd.. Aesthetics and Showmanship – Not stopping at mere outfits, They inject artistic creativity into their words and actions, too. Every day is a performance, and They love to put on a show.. Practical – To They, the world is meant to be felt and experienced. Truth is stranger than fiction, and They prefer to see and do than to wax philosophical about “what-ifs”.. Observant – With all this focus on the here and now, on doing and acting, it makes sense that They are naturals when it comes to noticing real, tangible things and changes.. Excellent People Skills – More so than things though, They love to pay attention to people. They are talkative, witty, and almost never run out of things to discuss. For people with this personality type, happiness and satisfaction stem from the time they spend with the people they enjoy being with."
ESFP,"Sensitive – They (especially Turbulent ones) are strongly emotional, and very vulnerable to criticism – they can feel like they’ve been backed into a corner, sometimes reacting badly. This is probably They’ greatest weakness, because it makes it so hard to address any other weaknesses brought to light.. Conflict-Averse – They sometimes ignore and avoid conflict entirely. They tend to say and do what’s needed to get out of such situations, then move on to something more fun.. Easily Bored – Without constant excitement, They find ways to create it themselves. Risky behavior, self-indulgence, and the pleasures of the moment over long-term plans are all things They get into a little too often.. Poor Long-Term Planners – In fact, XXXX personalities rarely make detailed plans for the future. To them, things come as they come, and they rarely bother with taking the time to lay out steps and consequences, with the belief that they could change at any moment – even with things that can be planned.. Unfocused – Anything that requires long-term dedication and focus is a particular challenge for They. In academics, dense, unchanging subjects like Classic Literature are much more difficult than more dynamic, relatable subjects like psychology. The trick for They is to find day-to-day joy in broader goals, and to tough it out with those tedious things that must be done."
ESFP,"They are social, fun-loving, free-spirited people who live life in the moment and squeeze every little bit of excitement from everything. Naturally, they don’t spare any of this freshness and energy when dating. For people with the XXXX personality type, relationships aren’t about slowly building foundations for the future, or planning out a life – they are bubbling, unpredictable things to be enjoyed for as long as there’s enjoyment to be had."
ESFP,"Of course, when that enjoyment does burn out, it’s gone. They reevaluate their situations and commitments constantly, regardless of professions of love and dedication today. If a week later they just don’t feel the same, that’s it, and XXXX personalities have no problem seriously considering breaking things off. While They can be willing to work on their relationships rather than swap them out, it takes a great deal of maturity and experience for them to realize that it can be worth the bother."
ESFP,"While they do last though, relationships with They are simply unforgettable. People with this personality type always have some new and exciting activity up their sleeves, and they genuinely enjoy spending each moment with their partners. They enjoy physical intimacy immensely, and they prove themselves affectionate, inquisitive, and open-minded lovers who love to share pleasure with willing and reciprocative partners."
ESFP,"Conversation with They is similar, focusing on fun, sometimes quirky subjects rather than deep, soul-searching expressions. The past and the future, the sciences and politics, and long-term plans and commitments are all routinely ignored by XXXX personalities. They slow things down and add too much weight to They’ freewheeling style."
ESFP,"Highly emotional people, and sensitive, They respond poorly to outside “suggestions” on how to manage their love lives. They respond even worse if criticisms come from their partners, and trying to take emotions out of the picture by telling They to “not take this personally” isn’t helpful either. Handling these situations better is a definite area for improvement for They, as there are entire dating strategies (pretty distasteful, manipulative ones) that revolve around exploiting this very trait."
ESFP,"On the other hand, the issue can be a lack of criticism at all. They value social input a lot, and are almost as affected by their friends’ opinions of their dating partners as their own. Since They are attracted to people who share their attitudes, whether dating partners or friends, this can leave them in an echo chamber that only tells them what they want to hear, reinforcing immature behaviors."
ESFP,"All of these tendencies can really come back to haunt people with the XXXX personality type later on. They’ tendency to avoid promises and commitments and jump from partner to partner sabotages necessary long-term goals like retirement planning. Building real relationships takes time and conscious effort."
ESFP,"Luckily, They are incredibly likeable people who enjoy life’s small pleasures, and hardly want for diversity in their partners. Enthusiastic and affectionate, with a pure and down-to-earth love that just takes things at face value, They are fortunate that they take the time to find someone they truly enjoy being with every day, rather than settling too soon for stability over happiness, only to lose both."
ESFP,"They are known for their irrepressibly social and excited attitudes. They don’t internalize much of anything, sharing it all with their extensive circles of friends with wit, style, enthusiasm, and optimism. They are explorers of the pleasures of life, and they take particular pleasure in sharing those experiences with others. For They, there’s no point in living if you can’t feel alive."
ESFP,"They are people of action. Getting out with activities that engage all five senses is XXXX personalities’ idea of a good time. Sometimes though, They may go too far with risky or careless behaviors, and try to bring others along for the ride. People with this personality type are sensitive, and rejecting these pastimes can be taken personally, ending friendships then and there. They don’t have time to be lectured."
ESFP,"Making new friends isn’t a problem for They though – they use an alluring combination of blunt truths and disarming openness and charm to keep things moving. Where XXXX personalities falter is in keeping the friends they already have. In their excitement and focus on here and now over history, They too easily exhaust the adventure one person has to offer, moving on once one person’s novelty has worn off."
ESFP,"This can all give the impression that They are shallow, pleasure-centric creatures who care little for anyone but themselves. This is a terrible misunderstanding, and far from the truth, but nevertheless makes friendships with Intuitive (N) personality types challenging. They care sincerely about their friends – it’s why they put so much effort into coming up with group experiences they believe everyone will enjoy – and they are deeply distressed by the occasional conflicts that end these relationships."
ESFP,"Novelty is king for people with the XXXX personality type, and there’s only so much diversity among fellow Explorer types. They love touching on intellectual and philosophical subjects, and they seek out a diversity of personality types and perspectives to keep among their friends. But as these friends grind into the details of some esoteric topic about the long-term consequences of faltering European economic output, They inevitably find their minds wandering, hoping for someone to rush up and say “Guess what just happened!”"
ESFP,"They are some of the most relaxed, fun-loving parents out there. Playing with children is a genuine pleasure for them, and people with the XXXX personality type constantly devise new and exciting ways to enjoy their time with their children. From the first moment they hold their babies, They are taken with the joy and wonder that their children experience in everything around them, and share and encourage it as much as possible."
ESFP,"Exploration and experiences are key philosophies for XXXX parents – when their children ask questions, the answer is “Let’s find out!” Overbearing structures and tightly scheduled activities aren’t a big part of XXXX personalities’ parenting. They’d much rather take things day by day and break up the crust by letting their children explore something new in their own way, something much appreciated by They’ children."
ESFP,"Discipline is far from their strongest suit, but hindsight and maturity have their effects, and They are often keen to prevent their children from suffering the same hurts and setbacks they themselves experienced. People with the XXXX personality type are quite sensitive themselves, and expect their children to be respectful and considerate with what rules there are, a point of contention through the teenage years."
ESFP,"They always keep up their end of the bargain though, providing plenty of emotional support. While not especially demanding parents, warm affection and a sense of practicality give XXXX personalities a very nurturing and encouraging parenting style, filling the gap nicely. When their children declare themselves future astronauts, They happily build make-believe spaceships, and later use those declarations to help their children focus on their schoolwork and goals. After all, successful astronauts need to know their math!"
ESFP,"They have a unique quality that makes them exceptional in some careers, and miserable in others – they mirror the mood around them. When people with the XXXX personality type are at a party or concert, they reflect that mood, giving them that “party people” image. When their friends are sad, they mirror that with sympathy and empathy. And when there is a crisis, They adapt as well, matching the intensity of the situation."
ESFP,"As a result, just about any career that focuses on working with others is a good fit, and is even essential for They to be happy and productive. XXXX personalities are natural event planners, sales representatives, trip planners, and tour guides, as each of these creates a sense of excitement, stimulation, and novelty between them and their customers."
ESFP,"They genuinely enjoy spending time with others and getting to know them, and have a knack for making people happy, even in the most frustrating situations. A good challenge is always appreciated by XXXX personalities, and they make wonderful and inspiring counselors, social workers, personal coaches, and consultants who improve employee or customer satisfaction."
ESFP,"With their ability to respond with resourcefulness and passion when their help is badly needed, They make brilliant medical professionals, especially as EMTs, paramedics, and nurses. They quickly pick up information about others, helping them get straight to the heart of the issue when dealing with the sick or injured. They thrive on intense emotion, and there’s hardly a better place for it."
ESFP,"Not everybody has the energy for that though, or wants the responsibility of life and death – some They prefer to make people happy and excited by creating beauty instead. People with this personality type have plenty of creative energy, and many build fulfilling careers in music, fashion, photography, and interior design. With the best aesthetic sense of any personality type, They are renowned for their sense of style."
ESFP,"However, jobs that eliminate human contact and focus on impartial, data-driven decisions are torturous to They. Some XXXX personalities do well enough by blowing off steam with friends after work, but for the most part, careers like technical writing or data analysis are poor fits. Add They’ loathing for schedules, structures, and repetition, and nine-to-five administrative work is quickly sent to the “nope” bin."
ESFP,"Regardless of where their diverse passions lie, They need freedom, novelty, and above all, human contact. People with the XXXX personality type need to know that they aren’t just appreciated, though that is very important, but liked. When They come in to work, they want to see a touch of chaos, and to navigate it with a crack team of capable friends who are all too happy to take action by their sides."
ESFP,"Regardless of what position They find themselves in at work, they share a desire to make the environment as friendly and enjoyable as possible. People with the XXXX personality type are able to take a social and relaxed attitude and use it to get everyone else on board with practical tasks that just need to get done. The more freedom They have to meet these needs, the better the results, so long as they know what the goal is, and there’s hardly a better personality type to have around in a dynamic, hectic work environment."
ESFP,"As subordinates, They thrive on change and new ideas, and loathe repetitive and strictly defined tasks. XXXX personalities’ managers find willing and able experimenters who can brainstorm, quickly grasp new methods, and actually put those methods to practical use – so long as They have a little leeway apply their own creative style. Changes may take a few tries though, as They can be forgetful in the heat of the moment, and can get more caught up in trying to get quick returns."
ESFP,"They give honest feedback on whether things make sense, but are quite sensitive to others’ criticism of their own habits. Under fire, people with this personality type (especially Turbulent ones) become defensive and are easily upset. But in the end, if they believe that the criticism comes from an honest intent to help, not hurt, They take it to heart. The biggest struggle for They in subordinate positions is that they value freedom and independence far more than safety and security – if their conditions aren’t met, they’re as likely to leave as make do."
ESFP,"If anyone can make friends with their colleagues and keep tension at bay within their team, it’s They. A fun atmosphere is important, and people with the XXXX personality type use their strong observational and social skills to bring everyone together, shifting a souring mood if need be. They rarely want for ideas on how to make this happen, happily organizing events and activities inside and outside the workplace. They’ spontaneity, wit, and enthusiasm have no equal."
ESFP,"As managers, They do everything they can to pump energy and fun into the day-to-day work that needs to be done. XXXX personalities enjoy being the center of attention, and even more so to feel like they’re needed and appreciated. Jumping into the thick of the work and applying themselves to anything they’d ask their subordinates to do is something They consider part of the job. Authority and social status are secondary to feeling like they’re an important part of a team that gets the job done."
ESFP,"They are great at noticing others’ moods, and there are few personality types better at preventing conflict and encouraging relaxed, enjoyable workplaces. Subordinates are always welcome to speak their minds, and people with this personality type are always happy to hear others out, especially if something is upsetting them. They’ ability to relate to others and think on their feet makes them resourceful and inspiring leaders."
ESFP,"Few personality types are as charming and attractive as They. Known for their ability to improvise and focus completely on the present, They are great at finding exciting new things to explore and experience. They’ energy, enthusiasm and down-to-earth attitude are invaluable in many areas, including their own personal growth."
ESTJ,"They thrive on order and continuity. Being extraverted, their focus involves organization of people, which translates into supervision. While They enjoy organizing and mobilizing people according to their own theories and tactically based agendas, They are content to enforce 'the rules,' often dictated by tradition or handed down from a higher authority."
ESTJ,"They are joiners. They seek out like-minded companions in clubs, civic groups, churches and other service organizations. The need for belonging is woven into the fiber of SJs. The family likewise is a central focus for They, and attendance at such events as weddings, funerals and family reunions is obligatory."
ESTJ,"Tradition is important to the XXXX. Holidays, birthdays and other annual celebrations are remembered and observed often religiously by this type. The XXXX is inclined to seek out his roots, to trace the family heritage back to honored ancestors both for a sense of family respectability and for a sense of security and belonging."
ESTJ,"Service, the tangible expression of responsibility, is another key focus for They. They love to provide and to receive good service. The XXXX merchant who provides dependable service has done much to enhance his or her self image."
ESTJ,"They have an acute sense for orthodoxy. Much of their evaluation of persons and activities reflects their strong sense of what is 'normal' and what isn't. XXXX humor is frequently centered around something or someone being off center or behaving abnormally."
ESTJ,"They promote the work ethic. Power, position and prestige should be worked for and earned. Laziness is rarely viewed with ambivalence nor benevolence by this type."
ESTJ,"The XXXX is outspoken, a person of principles, which are readily expressed. The XXXX is not afraid to stand up for what he or she believes is right even in the face of overwhelming odds. They are able to make the tough calls."
ESTJ,"Occupations attracting They include teaching, coaching, banking, political office, and management at all levels."
ESTJ,"They are very good at making impersonal decisions quickly, and standing by those decisions. They live in their Xx functioning, thus, their prime directive is in discovering that which is true and logical in the events of the real world. Circumstances calling for product invite the XXXX to supervise or direct other individuals toward production and productivity. Extraverts are attracted to the 'object,' the external things and people in observable reality. This bent translates into a natural interest in goods and material objects."
ESTJ,"The secondary Xx is like that of the XXXX, but not as strong. Xx provides practical form and concept data to the Xx head, however, form is not the overriding principle, especially if Thinking has already decided. In times of need, They are tempted to overlook even necessary information if its absence impedes closure. Secondary sensing sometimes translates into interest in sports. The persistence of primary Thinking gives many They a desire for discipline and regimen which can be beneficial in skills development in the arena."
ESTJ,"As the XXXX matures, and as situations arise which call for suspension of criticism, Xx is allowed to play. Under the leadership of the Xx function, iNtuition gravitates toward the discovery of broad categories which at worst amount to stereotypes. Those They who hone their Xx abilities may find success in academia. (I've encountered They whose Xx overshadows the auxiliary Xx function--for whatever reason--to the extent that there is an appearance of XXXX radical geekism.)"
ESTJ,"This function may rarely be expressed. They who have cultivated, or have been blessed with, a 'natural indirect expression of good will by inference,' have great prospects of developing genuine friendships (as opposed to They who merely act out the behavior of Xx). Such a weak, introverted function is best observed in facial expression, eye contact, body language, and verbally only by implication."
ESTJ,"They often find themselves in occupations that require thorough analysis, practical planning and organizational skills, process control and responsibility. They make good mid- and high-rank managers and executives. They succeed as military and police workers, politicians, engineers and entrepreneurs. They are found in technology companies among those who deal with practical aspects of technology (e.g. implementation specialists)."
ESTJ,"An XXXX’s interest in learning a subject is stimulated by the question, “Does this solve a problem?” If the answer is yes, the more thoroughly and specifically they can learn how, the greater their interest in the topic and the greater their desire to apply what they learn. Their interest in studying something is driven by the desire to gain practical experience in the implementation of certain ideas or activities."
ESTJ,"They are capable of processing material built on a logical framework, as well as large amounts of information lacking logical cohesion. They easily comprehend new material when it is demonstrated using straightforward, real-life examples. They understand the material in a concrete, factual way, and they immediately grasp how it can be used. Visual aids and active learning methods substantially improve their learning. They learn noticeably well in an organized educational system (e.g., an organized degree or certification program), but can also learn from sources not unified by a single formal learning process (e.g., individual courses or readings)."
ESTJ,"They are able to actively, accurately, and proficiently apply material they have learned well and understood in straightforward tasks."
ESTJ,"They are highly tolerant to high levels learning related stress. They prefer to evenly distribute their efforts when learning new material, although they are also capable of learning through relatively short periods of overexertion."
ESTJ,"In communication They are open but often demanding. They expect others to fulfill what was discussed and agreed upon, in due time and in the proper manner. They most often embody this attitude just as well toward themselves."
ESTJ,"They are usually not comfortable with situations requiring especially good people skills, e.g. being particularly delicate or patient. Their open and direct proclamation of their principles and intentions may sometimes hurt the feelings of the more feeling types (F) or provoke strong resistance on part of other leadership-oriented people who may have a different opinion."
ESTJ,"They often find it hard to express themselves when they have to talk about finer feelings: such topics as love or lyric poetry may not produce a strong emotional response in them. However, they are usually actively involved in events and gatherings that involve expression of feelings and emotions, such as feting persons of extraordinary bravery, or in charity events."
ESTJ,"An XXXX will normally have an extensive circle of friends, colleagues, and contacts they make during such events as receptions, meetings, entertainment events, and recreational activities."
ESTJ,"An XXXX's business communication is likely to be active and frequent. Their colleagues (or others who work in the same field) are often reliant on, or interested in, their competent opinion of counsel on professional subjects. Their business communication usually involves an exchange of opinions, as well as a discussion of management issues and practical solutions."
ISTJ,"They are often called inspectors. They have a keen sense of right and wrong, especially in their area of interest and/or responsibility. They are noted for devotion to duty. Punctuality is a watchword of the XXXX. The secretary, clerk, or business(wo)man by whom others set their clocks is likely to be an INFJ,"
ISTJ,"As do other Xxs, They often give the initial impression of being aloof and perhaps somewhat cold. Effusive expression of emotional warmth is not something that They do without considerable energy loss."
ISTJ,"They are most at home with 'just the facts, Ma'am.' They seem to perform at highest efficiency when employing a step-by-step approach. Once a new procedure has proven itself (i.e., has been shown 'to work,') the XXXX can be depended upon to carry it through, even at the expense of their own health."
ISTJ,"They are easily frustrated by the inconsistencies of others, especially when the second parties don't keep their commitments. But they usually keep their feelings to themselves unless they are asked. And when asked, they don't mince words. Truth wins out over tact. The grim determination of the XXXX vindicates itself in officiation of sports events, judiciary functions, or an other situation which requires making tough calls and sticking to them."
ISTJ,"Their XXXX orientation draws the XXXX into the service of established institutions. Home, social clubs, government, schools, the military, churches -- these are the bastions of the SJ. 'We've always done it this way' is often reason enough for many They. Threats to time-honored traditions or established organizations (e.g., a 'run' on the bank) are the undoing of SJs, and are to be fought at all costs."
ISTJ,"Xx is oriented toward the world of forms, essences, generics. Time is such a form, a quantifiable essense of exactitude, the standard to which external events are held. For both of the IS_J types, the sense of propriety comes from the clear definition of these internal forms. An apple 'should' have certain qualities, against which all apples are evaluated. A 'proper' chair has four legs, (and other qualities this poor XXXX can only guess). Jung viewed Xx as something of an oxymoron, in that the natural direction of senses is outward toward the object, rather than inward and away from it. One has the sense that Xxs are drawn more to the measure of the concept of the perceived object than to the experience of that perception."
ISTJ,"The moderation of the Xx function serves to socialize the expression of these forms. When the Xx function is ready to relinquish the data, Xx may speak. Otherwise, silence is golden. They seem to have a few favorite forms (the tried and true) which may serve for most occasions. My XXXX dad woke me every morning with the same phrase for more years than I care to remember. Asked, 'How are you?' he answered with the same stock phrase. ('As well as my age and habits will permit' was used for about two decades.) 'It's a good form, a sound form--it's the form for me.'"
ISTJ,"Since Xx is turned inward, it is rarely expressed. Perhaps this enables the XXXX to resolutely accept that 'we are all doomed.' When told that Lazarus had died, Thomas said, 'Let us go and die with him.' (He could just as well have said something like, 'I knew this was bound to happen sooner or later.') Only in times of great distress is the Xx expressed (as I witnessed in my dad when a neighbor's son was killed in a hunting accident). Otherwise, feeling is inferred, or expressed nonverbally, through eye contact, or an encouraging smile."
ISTJ,"The Xx function of an XXXX does not serve them very well. It needs a lot of help. For example, an XXXX was surprised to find that someone she had talked with only by phone had red hair, because she 'didn't usually like' people with red hair! This inferior Xx seems to be a major source of, and a natural breeding ground for, stereotypes. Failure of the banking system is but one bogeyman which arises from the fear which feeds on the XXXX's mistrust of real world possibilities. The shadow inhabiting the inferior Xx strikes at the precious forms and standards in the heart of the dominant Xx function."
ISTJ,"Due to their natural strengths They often find themselves in occupations that involve controlling production processes effectively, orientation to details, clear-cut planning, occupations that require responsibility and being an efficient worker. They are found across a wide range of industries and verticals, in organizations of all sizes. They succeed as military and police workers, engineers, auditors, lawyers, surgeons. They are found in technology companies among those who deal with the practical aspects of technology (e.g. implementation specialists). They make good project managers, mid-rank managers, department heads."
ISTJ,"In They, interest in learning a subject stems from the question, “Is this practical and useful to me?” The more precisely they can learn how something can be put to use or how they can operate it, the greater their interest in the topic and the greater their desire to apply what they learn."
ISTJ,"Their interest in studying something is driven by the desire to gain experience in successfully implementing plans or carrying out hands-on activities."
ISTJ,"They are capable of grasping material that has logical flow and material that consists of a set of practical information. They can take in large sets of conceptually unrelated information like facts or instructions. They are most receptive to new material when it is delivered using straightforward, real-life examples. They understand learned information concretely, and they immediately grasp how it can be practically applied. They are capable of learning independently, especially if the material is of practical nature. Group work with the material gives an XXXX no advantage compared to independent work."
ISTJ,"They are able to actively and effectively apply material they have learned and understood well in concrete tasks."
ISTJ,"They have a high degree of tolerance to high levels of learning related stress. They prefer to evenly distribute their efforts when learning new material."

They understand learned information concretely, and they immediately grasp how it can be practically applied. They are capable of learning independently, especially if the material is of practical nature. Group work with the material gives an XXXX no advantage compared to independent work."
ISTJ,"They are able to actively and effectively apply material they have learned and understood well in concrete tasks."
ISTJ,"They have a high degree of tolerance to high levels of learning related stress. They prefer to evenly distribute their efforts when learning new material."
ENTJ,"They have a natural tendency to marshall and direct. This may be expressed with the charm and finesse of a world leader or with the insensitivity of a cult leader. The XXXX requires little encouragement to make a plan. One XXXX put it this way... 'I make these little plans that really don't have any importance to anyone else, and then feel compelled to carry them out.' While 'compelled' may not describe They as a group, nevertheless the bent to plan creatively and to make those plans reality is a common theme for XXXX types."
ENTJ,"They are often 'larger than life' in describing their projects or proposals. This ability may be expressed as salesmanship, story-telling facility or stand-up comedy. In combination with the natural propensity for filibuster, our hero can make it very difficult for the customer to decline."
ENTJ,"TRADEMARK: -- 'I'm really sorry you have to die.' (I realize this is an overstatement. However, most Fs and other gentle souls usually chuckle knowingly at this description.)"
ENTJ,"They are decisive. They see what needs to be done, and frequently assign roles to their fellows. Few other types can equal their ability to remain resolute in conflict, sending the valiant (and often leading the charge) into the mouth of hell. When challenged, the XXXX may by reflex become argumentative. Alternatively (s)he may unleash an icy gaze that serves notice: the XXXX is not one to be trifled with."
ENTJ,"'Unequivocating' expresses the resoluteness of the XXXX's dominant function. Clarity of convictions endows these Thinkers with a knack for debate, or wanting knack, a penchant for argument. The light and heat generated by Thinking at the helm can be impressive; perhaps even overwhelming. Experience teaches many They that restraint may often be the better part of valor, lest one find oneself victorious but alone."
ENTJ,"The auxiliary function explores the blueprints of archetypal patterns and equips Thinking with a fresh, dynamic sense of how things work. Improvising on the fly is something many They do very well. As Thinking's subordinate, insights are of value only insofar as they further the Right, True Cause celebre. [n.b.: They are capable of living on a higher plane, if you will, and learning to value individuals even above their principles. The above dynamic suggests less individuation.]"
ENTJ,"Sensing reaches out to embrace that which physically touches it. They have an awareness of the real; of that which exists. By stilling the engines of Thinking and iNtuition, this type may experience the Here and Now, and know things not dreamt of nor even postulated in iNtuition's philosophy. Sensing's minor role, however, puts it at risk for distortion or extreme weakness beneath the hustle and bustle of the giants N and T."
ENTJ,"Feeling is romantic, as the ethereal as the inner world from whence it doth emerge. When it be awake, feeling evokes great passion that knows not nuance of proportion nor context. Perhaps these lesser functions inspire glorious recreational quests in worlds that never were, or may only ever be in fantasy. When overdone or taken too seriously, Xx turned outward often becomes maudlin or melodramatic. Feeling in this type appears most authentic when implied or expressed covertly in a firm handshake, accepting demeanor, or act of sacrifice thinly covered by excuses of lack of any personal interest in the relinquished item."
ENTJ,"They often find themselves in occupations that require good analytical and planning skills. They build successful careers in those areas that require considerable organizational skills and intellectual effort, in occupations that present a challenge and call for creativity. They are greatly represented in technological and management consulting companies among engineers and developers, and among high- and mid-rank managers. They are also able to realize their potential in start-ups where they often fulfill management positions or take responsibility for the whole project."
ENTJ,"An XXXX’s interest in learning a subject lies in the answer to the question “Will this help me solve a problem?” If the answer is yes, the more thoroughly and extensively they can learn how, the greater the XXXX’s interest in the given topic, and the greater their desire to apply what they learn. Their interest in studying something is driven both by the desire to learn about ideas of popular interest, as well as by the need to find practical solutions to pressing problems."
ENTJ,"They are easily receptive to learning material when it is presented in a theoretical form, and new information flows logically from information given earlier. This type has a comprehensive understanding of new material and immediately grasps how it can be applied in various ways. They learn well in an organized educational system (e.g., an organized degree or certification program), but learn just as well from sources not unified by a single formal learning process (e.g., individual courses or readings)."
ENTJ,"They are capable of mechanical memorization, although the amount retained this way is less than when memorization is based on a generalized understanding of the material. They retain information best when it is presented from various perspectives and using various examples. Memorizing material presented as a collection of poorly interrelated items is mentally straining for an INFJ,"
ENTJ,"They are capable of actively applying material they have learned well to their work. They are able to use it in clearly defined applications as well as by drawing creative conclusions on how it can be used for other purposes."
ENTJ,"They are able to remain very stable when experiencing a high level of learning related stress. They prefer to evenly distribute their efforts in learning new material, although they are capable of learning through short periods of overexertion."
ENTJ,"They respect and maintain the manners and order accepted in their circle. They may often come across as demanding, but as a rule, not when it comes to minor issues. They are ready to share their opinion with those around them and to find out theirs. At the same time, they often strive to ensure that their opinion be the one recognized as the right one. Their objective, business-like, confident and at times bossy conversation style can be upsetting to people of a more feeling type or result in counteraction on the part of others who are also disposed toward leadership."
ENTJ,"They can encounter difficulties when communication requires finer soft skills, such as being very tactful or particularly patient, or involves the finer feelings of the soul. The topics of love or lyric poetry can fail to elicit a strong emotional response in them. At the same time, they often take an active part at events or gatherings related to expressions of feelings, for instance, in organizing charity or other public events."
ENTJ,"They usually have a large social circle including their friends, colleagues, and contacts made at parties, gatherings, during time off work or entertainment events they might be attending."
ENTJ,"Business communication of They tends to be pretty intense. Their colleagues (or others who work in the same field) often find it important or necessary to get their authoritative and/or expert opinion on professional subjects. For They, communication usually includes opinions, ideas, discussing organizational management aspects and practical solutions."
INTJ,"To outsiders, They may appear to project an aura of 'definiteness', of self-confidence. This self-confidence, sometimes mistaken for simple arrogance by the less decisive, is actually of a very specific rather than a general nature; its source lies in the specialized knowledge systems that most people of this type start building at an early age. When it comes to their own areas of expertise -- and They can have several -- they will be able to tell you almost immediately whether or not they can help you, and if so, how. They know what they know, and perhaps still more importantly, they know what they don't know."
INTJ,"People of this type are perfectionists, with a seemingly endless capacity for improving upon anything that takes their interest. What prevents them from becoming chronically bogged down in this pursuit of perfection is the pragmatism so characteristic of the type: They apply (often ruthlessly) the criterion 'Does it work?' to everything from their own research efforts to the prevailing social norms. This in turn produces an unusual independence of mind, freeing them from the constraints of authority, convention, or sentiment for its own sake."
INTJ,"They are known as the 'Systems Builders' of the types, perhaps in part because they possess the unusual trait combination of imagination and reliability. Whatever system this type happens to be working on is for them the equivalent of a moral cause to an XXXX; both perfectionism and disregard for authority may come into play, as They can be unsparing of both themselves and the others on the project. Anyone considered to be 'slacking,' including superiors, will lose their respect -- and will generally be made aware of this; They have also been known to take it upon themselves to implement critical decisions without consulting their supervisors or co-workers. On the other hand, they do tend to be scrupulous and even-handed about recognizing the individual contributions that have gone into a project, and have a gift for seizing opportunities which others might not even notice."
INTJ,"In the broadest terms, what They 'do' tends to be what they 'know'. Typical XXXX career choices are in the sciences and engineering, but they can be found wherever a combination of intellect and incisiveness are required (e.g., law, some areas of academia). People of this type can rise to management positions when they are willing to invest time in marketing their abilities as well as enhancing them, and (whether for the sake of ambition or the desire for privacy) many also find it useful to learn to simulate some degree of surface conformism in order to mask their inherent unconventionality."
INTJ,"Personal relationships, particularly romantic ones, can be the XXXX's Achilles heel. While they are capable of caring deeply for others (usually a select few), and are willing to spend a great deal of time and effort on a relationship, the knowledge and self-confidence that make them so successful in other areas can suddenly abandon or mislead them in interpersonal situations."
INTJ,"This happens in part because many They do not readily grasp the social rituals; for instance, they tend to have little patience and less understanding of such things as small talk and flirtation (which most types consider half the fun of a relationship). To complicate matters, people of this type are usually extremely private, and can often be naturally impassive as well, which makes them easy to misread and misunderstand. Perhaps the most fundamental problem, however, is that They really want people to make sense. :-) This sometimes results in a peculiar naivete', paralleling that of many Fs -- only instead of expecting inexhaustible affection and empathy from a romantic relationship, the XXXX will expect inexhaustible reasonability and directness."
INTJ,"Probably the strongest XXXX assets in the interpersonal area are their intuitive abilities and their willingness to 'work at' a relationship. Although as Ts they do not always have the kind of natural empathy that many Fs do, the Intuitive function can often act as a good substitute by synthesizing the probable meanings behind such things as tone of voice, turn of phrase, and facial expression. This ability can then be honed and directed by consistent, repeated efforts to understand and support those they care about, and those relationships which ultimately do become established with an XXXX tend to be characterized by their robustness, stability, and good communications."
INTJ,"They are idea people. Anything is possible; everything is negotiable. Whatever the outer circumstances, people of this type are ever perceiving inner pattern-forms and using real-world materials to operationalize them. Others may see what is and wonder why; They see what might be and say 'Why not?!' Paradoxes, antinomies, and other contradictory phenomena aptly express these intuitors' amusement at those whom they feel may be taking a particular view of reality too seriously. People of this type enjoy developing unique solutions to complex problems."
INTJ,"Thinking in this auxiliary role is a workhorse. Closure is the payoff for efforts expended. Evaluation begs diagnosis; product drives process. As they come to light, Thinking tends, protects, affirms and directs iNtuition's offspring, fully equipping them for fulfilling and useful lives. A faithful pedagogue, Thinking argues not so much on its own behalf, but in defense of its charges. And through this process these impressionable ideas take on the likeness of their master."
INTJ,"Feeling has a modest inner room, two doors down from the Most Imminent iNtuition. It doesn't get out much, but lends its influence on behalf of causes which are Good and Worthy and Humane. We may catch a glimpse of it in the unspoken attitude of good will, or the gracious smile or nod. Some question the existence of Feeling in this type, yet its unseen balance to Thinking is a cardinal dimension in the full measure of the XXXX's soul."
INTJ,"Sensing serves with a good will, or not at all. As other inferior functions, it has only a rudimentary awareness of context, amount or degree. Thus people of this type sweat the details or, at times, omit them. 'I've made up my mind, don't confuse me with the facts' could well have been said by an XXXX on a mission. Sensing's extraverted attitude is evident in this type's bent to savor sensations rather than to merely categorize them. Indiscretions of indulgence are likely an expression of the unconscious vengeance of the inferior."
INTJ,"Generally, They have successful careers in areas requiring intense intellectual effort, those that present intellectual challenges, and require a creative approach. Due to the characteristics mentioned above, successful They are found in technological companies, particularly in research and development, and among corporate lawyers, high- and mid-rank managers in technology companies and financial institutions."
INTJ,"In They, interest in learning a subject revolves around finding the answer to the question, “Why is this so?” The clearer and deeper the answer this type receives during the learning process, the greater their interest in the topic, and the greater their desire to delve deeper into the subject."
INTJ,"Their desire to study something is driven by a search for ideas that can answer not only fundamental questions, but also practical questions of popular interest."
INTJ,"They are easily receptive to difficult material when it is presented in conceptual form and new information follows logically from that given before. A moderate pace is best when delivering material, because They spend time forming and retaining theoretical connections between different pieces of information."
INTJ,"They connect the information they receive to a unifying theoretical basis. They can retain knowledge remembered in this way for decades. They are also capable of mechanical memorization, although the amount thus retained is substantially lower than from memory based on a generalized understanding of the material. Repeatedly presenting the same material helps They remember it, but presenting it from different points of view and using various examples is even more effective."
INTJ,"XXXX’s are able to accurately reproduce received information, especially if it is mentally organized in a conceptual way. Mechanical reproduction is substantially less accurate, which is usually linked to this type’s relative weakness when it comes to remembering material with poor logical flow. On top of this, they are capable of highly accurate recollection of visual information that lacks logical flow, if it was received under intensely focused attention. For example, They can reproduce many details of the rapidly changing scenery when driving in a car. This seems to be related to the fact that they are shutting off the reflection process when taking in the information."
INTJ,"They learn best when teaching is systematic (e.g., an organized degree or certification program) and intensive. However, they are also able to learn material from sources not unified by a single formal learning process (e.g., individual courses or readings). Independent work with the material being studied is valuable to their learning. The difficulty of the material only increases an XXXX’s drive to understand it, and They are capable of learning material on their own. Visual aids help them learn, but are not very important for their overall assimilation of a topic."
INTJ,"They are good at actively working with material they understand and receive great satisfaction from it. They are able to apply it in concrete tasks or develop it and expand on it in an assigned direction."
INTJ,"They have a high tolerance to high levels of learning related stress. However, they prefer to evenly distribute their efforts when learning new material, rather than resorting to last-minute cramming."
INTJ,"They try to figure out how the world around them is structured and what can be changed in it. They feel the best when they have figured something out and know how to improve it."
INTJ,"They are comfortable carrying out a conversation. They are neither arrogant nor are they formal, but might refrain from becoming quick acquaintances. They can come up against difficulties in situations requiring finer soft skills when communicating, such as being very tactful or particularly patient. On the whole, They respect the established rules of communications although at times they may see them as a formality or a relic of tradition."
INTJ,"They may find it difficult to express themselves about the finer feelings of the soul: the topics of love or lyric poetry can fail to elicit a strong emotional response in them."
INTJ,"In communication They usually come across as well thought out and to the point. Despite their introversive attitude, when they have something they find profoundly interesting, like an idea or project of some sort, their enthusiasm about it may become quite “contagious” and can spread to those around them."
INTJ,"At times, They seem somewhat closed and distant in communication. But it is during this time that they are revising their views and conceptions, and/or are involved in forming new ones. Those who can guess the reasons for their apparent detachedness can easily engage They in conversation by making some critical comment regarding the concepts They have deduced. In these situations They can quite often become wordy and very talkative."
INTJ,"An XXXX’s social contacts are, as a rule, low in number and mostly limited to his or her circle of relatives, friends, colleagues and others of a like mind."
INTJ,"That being said, They can have quite a few business contacts, because many people find it interesting or important to get an XXXX’s in-depth expert opinion, which they can offer on many serious issues. Their business communication usually includes exchange of points of view, ideas, discussing organizational methods and solutions."
ESTP,"They are spontaneous, active folks. Like the other SPs, They get great satisfaction from acting on their impulses. Activities involving great power, speed, thrill and risk are attractive to the XXXX. Chronic stifling of these impulses makes the XXXX feel 'dead inside'."
ESTP,"Gamesmanship is the calling card of the XXXX. Persons of this type have a natural drive to best the competition. Some of the most successful salespersons are They. P.T. Barnum ('Never give a sucker an even break') illustrates the unscrupulous contingent of this type."
ESTP,"Almost unconsciously They look for nonverbal, nearly subliminal cues as to what makes their quarry 'tick'. Once they know, they wait for just the right time to trump the unsuspecting victim's ace and glory in their conquest. Oddly enough, They seem to admire and respect anyone who can beat them at their own game."
ESTP,"'If I was any better, I couldn't stand it!' To an XXXX, admission of weakness feels like failure. He admires strength in himself and in others."
ESTP,"'Shock effect' is a favored technique of this type to get the attention of his audience. They love to be at center stage, demonstrating feats of wonder and daring."
ESTP,"These are the ultimate realists. Xxs are at one with objects and experiences now, in the only living, pulsing moment that ever really exists. The Sensor is compelled to see, touch, taste, smell and feel all that moves, wafts, tingles, tinkles, scintillates, vibrates or resonates. Some They are keenly discriminating; only those elements of singular quality and experience will suffice. Others revel in earthiness. If baseness can elicit shock from more squeamish observers, so much the better."
ESTP,"Even a consummate Sensor needs to decide which hand to grasp the gusto with; Xx is their preferred yardstick. Introverted, and auxiliary to Sensing, the T function maintains a low profile, keeps its opinions mainly to itself, and readily yields to allow Sensing to savor a special moment. The XXXX preference for mental, physical and emotional toughness surely can be traced to this detached, rational function."
ESTP,"Though only a minor character, Feeling plays an important role in a favorite pastime of They. This is not to say that They don't care deeply for others, yet Feeling is such a ready hand-puppet, expedient in disarming the 'victim' and exposing the jugular. Sincere Feeling is tertiary and thus relatively simplistic in this type. As such, it can be the undoing of They at the hands of those they (perhaps unconsciously) come to trust."
ESTP,"In the inferior (fourth) position, intuition may be virtually absent much of the time. Haziness of inner, symbolic vision is the psychic price of the clarity of sensory awareness. As do other SPs, They reserve a certain 'gut' sense of timing and luck. When repression and stress empower the Shadow, it likely finds expression through intuition in stereotypic perceptions of groups and individuals whom it perceives and hostile or hurtful."
ESTP,"They often find themselves in occupations that require prompt and active responses. They succeed as salespeople, crime and fraud investigators, sailors, racecar drivers, athletes, actors, entrepreneurs, rescue operation staff, and occasionally politicians and special combat forces. Many They are found among implementation and maintenance specialists."
ESTP,"In They, interest in learning a subject is driven by the question, “Will learning this help me act more effectively?” If the answer is yes, the more thoroughly and specifically they can learn what they can do, the greater their interest in the topic, and the greater their desire to apply what they learn. Their interest in studying something is stimulated by the desire to find practical solutions to pressing problems."
ESTP,"They understand learned information in a concrete, factual way and immediately grasp how it can be applied. They can learn well in both an organized educational system (e.g., an organized degree or certification program), as well as from sources not unified by a single formal learning process (e.g., individual courses or readings). They are able to learn material on their own - mostly that of practical nature."
ESTP,"They easily and quickly retain new material if it is presented as a practical guide for action. They are capable of remembering material built on a logical framework, as well as substantial amounts of information lacking logical cohesion. Retention is improved if the material is delivered using a variety of examples. They are able to accurately reproduce received information, including details of rapidly changing environment."
ESTP,"They are capable of actively using material they have learned well and understood in concrete, straightforward applications."
ESTP,"They have a moderate level of tolerance to high levels of learning related stress. They do not always evenly distribute their efforts when learning new material."
ESTP,"They are active communicators who know how to persuade and engage others with their speech. However, some people may be offended by their straightforwardness. The more variety They have in their communication, the more energetic they are and the greater their sense of fulfillment in life. They find it easy to communicate with various personality types, although they tend to be more superficial with some of them. They sometimes find it hard to express finer feelings; such topics as love, lyric poetry, and any subtleties of emotional experience may not evoke a strong emotional response in them."
ESTP,"They often have many friends and acquaintances, with whom they discuss practical measures and actions that need to be taken to address certain issues."
ESTP,"They tend to have a large number of business contacts, and they actively and frequently interact with them. Those who work in their field are often interested in their professional opinion. An XXXX's business communication is usually focused on the exchange of opinions, as well as the discussion of concrete measures and practical solutions."
ISTP,"Like their fellow SPs, They are fundamentally Performers (note the capital 'P' :-)), but as Ts their areas of interest tend to be mechanical rather than artistic like those of They, and unlike most ESPs they do not present an impression of constant activity. On the contrary, they lie dormant, saving their energy until a project or an adventure worthy of their time comes along--and then they launch themselves at it. The apparently frenzied state that inevitably ensues is actually much more controlled than it appears--They always seem to know what they're doing when it comes to physical or mechanical obstacles--but the whole chain of events presents a confusing and paradoxical picture to an outsider."
ISTP,"They are equally difficult to understand in their need for personal space, which in turn has an impact on their relationships with others. They need to be able to 'spread out'--both physically and psychologically--which generally implies encroaching to some degree on others, especially if they decide that something of someone else's is going to become their next project. (They are generally quite comfortable, however, with being treated the same way they treat others--at least in this respect.) But because they need such a lot of flexibility to be as spontaneous as they feel they must be, they tend to become as inflexible as the most rigid J when someone seems to be threatening their lifestyle (although they usually respond with a classic XXXX rage which is yet another vivid contrast to their 'dormant,' impassive, detached mode). These territorial considerations are usually critical in relationships with They; communication also tends to be a key issue, since they generally express themselves non-verbally. When they do actually verbalize, They are masters of the one-liner, often showing flashes of humor in the most tense situations; this can result in their being seen as thick-skinned or tasteless."
ISTP,"Like most SPs, They may have trouble with rote and abstract classroom learning, which tend not to be good measures of their actual intelligence. They tend, sometimes with good reason, to be highly skeptical of its practical value, and often gravitate towards classes in industrial arts; part-time vocational/ technical programs can be useful to even the college-bound XXXX. In terms of careers, mechanics and any of the skilled trades are traditional choices, and those They with strong numerical as well mechanical gifts tend to do extremely well in most areas of engineering. Working as paramedics or firefighters can fulfill the XXXX need to live on the edge; they are at their best in a crisis, where their natural disregard for rules and authority structures allows them to focus on and tackle the emergency at hand in the most effective way."
ISTP,"They with more sedate careers usually take on high-risk avocations like racing, skydiving, and motorcycling. While aware of the dangers involved, they are so in touch with the physical world that they know they can get away with much smaller safety margins than other types."
ISTP,"Thinking, the dominant function, generally keeps its opinions to itself. The inner world of Xxs resembles Plato's rec room, where every untried idea runs the gauntlet of Truth. The personal or political source of the alleged fact matters little to Thinking; each tenet must stand on its own premises. Xxs focus their directives in on themselves, and would like nothing better than for others to do the same. One XXXX friend displays a poster of an orangutan with the caption, 'If I want your opinion, I'll beat it out of you.' Suffice it to say that They are by nature free spirits."
ISTP,"Auxiliary Sensing provides Thinking with all manner of information about the physical world. They possess heightened sensory awareness. And as other SPs, They are energized by responding to their impulses. Sports appeal to many They for the sheer sensory experience."
ISTP,"This combination of dominant Xx and auxiliary Xx results in no-nonsense realism. The uncanny troubleshooting ability which predisposes many They to hands-on diagnostics (especially with machinery and computers) or detective work is most probably rooted in this pairing."
ISTP,"Tertiary iNtuition maintains a low profile. They are prone to consult 'gut feelings' that most probably arise from this function unconsciously. As with other XXXX types, They generally lack enthusiasm for theoretical and philosophical issues, and less for the endless discussions in which the Intuitive (especially NP) types so frequently engage."
ISTP,"The inferior (least) feeling function is extraverted and, when operative, quite visible. As with all types, the inferior function is relatively simplistic and often operates unconsciously in an all-or-nothing manner. When operative, Feeling's sensitivity and loyalty has the potential for great benefit and utter peril. It would seem that They would do well to nourish and cherish Feeling judgement, but to vigilantly supervise and protect it from predators and other catastrophes."
ISTP,"Due to their natural strengths They often find themselves in occupations that involve direct participation in manufacturing, the production or maintenance process, in fields that require a good understanding of details. They succeed as technicians, mechanics, electricians, electrical, mechanical and other maintenance and repair specialists, trouble-shooters, handymen, drivers, programmers, athletes. They are good in rescue operations and in any occupation that is action-oriented and requires specialized skills as well as analytical thinking."
ISTP,"In They, interest in learning a subject stems from the question, “How does this work?” The more precisely they can learn how something can be put to use or how they can operate it, the greater their interest in learning about it and actually putting the knowledge to practice."
ISTP,"Their interest in studying something is driven by their desire to learn skills that will allow them to work actively with (e.g., operate, maintain, repair) various devices and systems."
ISTP,"They are capable of grasping sets of practical information, as well as information based on logical conclusions. They easily comprehend new material when it is delivered using straightforward, real-life examples. They understand the learning material concretely and immediately grasp how it can be applied. They are capable of independently assimilating new material. Group work with the material being studied does not give an XXXX any advantage compared to independent work. They are capable of accurately reproducing received information and are able to notice and remember many small details of a rapidly changing sequence of events."
ISTP,"They are also capable of working actively with material they have learned and understood well. They can precisely and skillfully apply it in concrete tasks."
ISTP,"They have a moderate degree of tolerance to high levels of learning related stress. They do not always evenly distribute their efforts when it comes to learning new material."
ISTP,"They are open and straightforward in their communication. They tend to observe the rules and communication norms of their social milieu. However, they may have difficulty establishing a good relationship with people that they consider to be overly demanding."
ISTP,"They feel ill at ease in situations requiring finer people skills e.g. particular tactfulness and consideration. Some people may be offended by the They' direct manner of expressing their opinions."
ISTP,"They often find it hard to express themselves when it comes to finer feelings. So, for instance, the discussion of love, lyric poetry or subtleties of emotional experiences may not evoke a strong reaction from them."
ISTP,"They often have many friends and acquaintances, with whom they discuss practical measures and actions to address day-to-day issues."
ISTP,"An XXXX's business communication is likely to be focused on the solution of tangible, current issues, which often involve an exchange of opinions and practical solutions. Most of their contacts are people who belong to the same sensing/thinking typological group (ST)."
ENTP,"'Clever' is the word that perhaps describes They best. The professor who juggles half a dozen ideas for research papers and grant proposals in his mind while giving a highly entertaining lecture on an abstruse subject is a classic example of the type. So is the stand-up comedian whose lampoons are both funny and incisively accurate."
ENTP,"They are usually verbally as well as cerebrally quick, and generally love to argue--both for its own sake, and to show off their debating skills. They tend to have a perverse sense of humor as well, and enjoy playing devil's advocate. This sometimes confuses, even angers, those who don't understand or accept the concept of argument as a sport."
ENTP,"They are as innovative and ingenious at problem-solving as they are at verbal gymnastics; on occasion, however, they manage to outsmart themselves. They can be prone to 'sharp practice' – especially cutting corners without regard to the rules if it's expedient – or, their juggling acts may simply be so over-ambitious they collapse."
ENTP,"Both at work and at home, They are very fond of 'toys' -- physical or intellectual, the more sophisticated the better. Once these have been 'solved' or become too familiar, however, they’ll be replaced with new ones."
ENTP,"They are basically optimists, but in spite of this (perhaps because of it?), they can become petulant about small setbacks and inconveniences. (Major setbacks they regard as challenges, and tackle with determination.) They have little patience with those they consider wrongheaded or unintelligent, and show little restraint in demonstrating this. In general, however, they are genial, even charming, when not being harassed by life."
ENTP,"In terms of their relationships with others, They are capable of bonding very closely and suddenly with their loved ones. Some appear deceptively offhand with their nearest and dearest; others are so demonstrative that they succeed in shocking co-workers who've only seen their professional side. They are also quick to spot a kindred spirit, and good at acquiring friends of similar temperament and interests."
ENTP,"They may sometimes give the impression of being largely oblivious to the rest of humanity except as an audience: good, bad, or potential. In general this is unfair – but it can be difficult to get an XXXX’s attention when they’re not immediately aware of you, especially for an Introvert."
ENTP,"The best approach in communicating with an XXXX is to be straightforward. No games – they’ll win. No 'pulling rank' – they’ll just want to put you in your place. No apologies – you’ll undermine yourself. Try 'I need/want to talk to you.' "
ENTP,"They are nothing if not unique. Brave new associations flow freely from the unconscious into the world of the living. Making, discovering and developing connections between and among two or more of anything is virtually automatic. The product of intuition is merely an icon of process; They are in the business of change, improvement, experimentation."
ENTP,"The attraction Xx has toward the real and physical amounts to a cosmic non sequitur: theory is drawn to practice. Such encounters are clearly puzzling. Both parties--the intuitor and the realist--are aware of a xenic quality in their meeting, with reactions ranging from recoil to reverie."
ENTP,"Thinking is iNtuition's ready assistant, an embodiment of the sort of logic found in laws, boards and circuits. Thinking's job is to lend focus and direction to iNtuition's critical mass. The temporary habitations of changeling iNtuition are constructed of Boolean materials from Thinking's storehouse. Ultimately, Thinking is no match for iNtuition's prodigiousness. Systems lie in various states of disarray, fragmentary traces of Thinking's feverish attempts to shadow and undergird the leaps of the dominant function. One can only suppose that Thinking must continue to work during REM sleep pulling together iNtuition's brainchildren into integral wholes."
ENTP,"To the extent that Feeling is developed, They extravert Feeling judgment. As a result, it is not uncommon to find affability and bonhomie in members of this species. Tertiary functions are potentially utilitarian. Their limitations appear in their relative underdevelopment, diminished endurance, and vulnerability. They may harness Feeling's good will in areas such as sales, service, drama, humor and art. XXXX loyalty often runs high and can be hooked by those the XXXX counts as friends."
ENTP,"Like a tail on the kite of iNtuition, Xx counterweighs these beings drawn to nonconformity and anarchy. These shadowy sensory forms, so familiar to XXXX types, serve as lodestones which many They employ Herculean measures to escape. 'Question authority! (then do exactly what it tells you)' sums up the dilemma in which They may find themselves by attempting to best the tarbaby Sensing. Occasionally acknowledging awareness of norms and abnormality could, in theory, be potentially freeing."
ENTP,"Additionally, I've noticed that They have the need to have areas of expertise/excellence/uniqueness in which one is second to none. I've never beaten an XXXX at his/her own game--not in the final analysis. (e.g., just tonight, my neighbor who is recuperating from an illness received a call from an XXXX friend offering his special recipe for tea. The instructions required only the finest ingredients, a particular brand of orange juice, tea made with a ball--none of those horrid teabags--..., which will of course make the best tea of which he himself drinks 50 gallons each winter!)"
ENTP,"Generally, They build successful careers in areas requiring intense intellectual effort, a creative approach, and those that present an intellectual challenge. Because of the characteristics mentioned above, They are often found in research, development, and analytical departments. They often make very successful careers in academia thanks to their strong and versatile way of thinking along with their great erudition."
ENTP,"An XXXX’s interest in learning a subject is motivated by their desire to answer the question, “In what ways can the given problem be solved?” The more solutions they learn of, the greater their interest in the given topic and the greater their desire to understand it."
ENTP,"They are motivated to study something when it allows them to find solutions to complex, intellectually challenging tasks."
ENTP,"They easily take in material when it is presented in a conceptual form and new information logically flows from that previously given. People of this type understand new material from multiple angles - beyond what they are explicitly taught - and immediately pick up on how it can be applied. They are capable of independently learning expansive and complex material; the complexity of the material only intensifies their drive to master it. Material laid out in an intriguing way and/or presented as new and unexplored sharply increases the interest of an XXXX. They are capable of learning from sources not unified by a single formal learning process (e.g., individual courses or readings)."
ENTP,"They are able to accurately reproduce theoretical information and information that lacks logical flow. Group work with the material being studied does not give an XXXX any advantage over individual work."
ENTP,"They are capable of actively applying material they have learned well and internalized. They are good at using it in obvious, straightforward applications as well as taking an innovative approach to the material."
ENTP,"They have a significant degree of tolerance to high levels of learning related stress. They don’t always evenly distribute their efforts when learning new material."
ENTP,"In the process of communication, They try to bring to light the logical connections between phenomena and events and provide explanations for them. They find great satisfaction in having their inferences recognized by the other party."
ENTP,"They are interesting and easy to talk to, although some of their conversation partners may be exhausted by the somewhat adversarial form their communication takes. As a rule, They feel at ease conversing in a group, while they actively assert their independent view on the topic of discussion. For them, friendly conversations usually work out with people of equal intellect."
ENTP,"In communication, They usually come across as confident, precise and objective. They strive to maintain their characteristic objective and methodical evaluation, even when discussing topics relating to the finer feelings of the soul. Thus, for example, topics of love and lyric poetry also make them want to find ways to analyze the subject of the emotions."
ENTP,"The typical social circle of They for the most part consists of relatives, friends and co-workers. At the same time, They are quick off the mark and communicate fairly actively with a variety of different people at parties, meetings and recreational gatherings."
ENTP,"As a rule, business communication of They is intense. To their colleagues (or other people working in the same field), it is important to figure out an XXXX’s in-depth expert opinion on many professional issues. The topics of discussion for They usually include exchange of opinions and ideas, and critical analysis of new approaches and methods."
INTP,"They are pensive, analytical folks. They may venture so deeply into thought as to seem detached, and often actually are oblivious to the world around them."
INTP,"Precise about their descriptions, They will often correct others (or be sorely tempted to) if the shade of meaning is a bit off. While annoying to the less concise, this fine discrimination ability gives They so inclined a natural advantage as, for example, grammarians and linguists."
INTP,"They are relatively easy-going and amenable to almost anything until their principles are violated, about which they may become outspoken and inflexible. They prefer to return, however, to a reserved albeit benign ambiance, not wishing to make spectacles of themselves."
INTP,"major concern for They is the haunting sense of impending failure. They spend considerable time second-guessing themselves. The open-endedness (from Perceiving) conjoined with the need for competence (NT) is expressed in a sense that one's conclusion may well be met by an equally plausible alternative solution, and that, after all, one may very well have overlooked some critical bit of data. An XXXX arguing a point may very well be trying to convince himself as much as his opposition. In this way They are markedly different from They, who are much more confident in their competence and willing to act on their convictions."
INTP,"Mathematics is a system where many They love to play, similarly languages, computer systems--potentially any complex system. They thrive on systems. Understanding, exploring, mastering, and manipulating systems can overtake the XXXX's conscious thought. This fascination for logical wholes and their inner workings is often expressed in a detachment from the environment, a concentration where time is forgotten and extraneous stimuli are held at bay. Accomplishing a task or goal with this knowledge is secondary."
INTP,"They and Logic -- One of the tipoffs that a person is an XXXX is his or her obsession with logical correctness. Errors are not often due to poor logic -- apparent faux pas in reasoning are usually a result of overlooking details or of incorrect context."
INTP,"Games NTs seem to especially enjoy include Risk, Bridge, Stratego, Chess, Go, and word games of all sorts. (I have an XXXX friend that loves Boggle and its variations. We've been known to sit in public places and pick a word off a menu or mayonnaise jar to see who can make the most words from its letters on a napkin in two minutes.) The XXXX mailing list has enjoyed a round of Metaphore, virtual volleyball, and a few 'finish the series' brain teasers."
INTP,"They in the main are not clannish. The XXXX mailing list, with a readership now in triple figures, was in its incipience fraught with all the difficulties of the Panama canal: we had trouble deciding:. whether or not there should be such a group,. exactly what such a group should be called, and. which of us would have to take the responsibility for organization and maintenance of the aforesaid group/club/whatever."
INTP,"Xx strives to extract the essence of the Idea from various externals that express it. In the extreme, this conceptual essence wants no form or substance to verify its reality. Knowing the Truth is enough for They; the knowledge that this truth can (or could) be demonstrated is sufficient to satisfy the knower. 'Cogito, ergo sum' expresses this prime directive quite succinctly."
INTP,"In seasons of low energy level, or moments of single-minded concentration, the XXXX is aloof and detached in a way that might even offend more relational or extraverted individuals."
INTP,"Intuition softens and socializes Thinking, fleshing out the brittle bones of truths formed in the dominant inner world. That which is is not negotiable; yet actual application diffuses knowledge to the extent that knowledge needs qualification and context to be of any consequence in this foreign world of substance."
INTP,"If Thinking can desist, the XXXX is free to brainstorm, calling up the perceptions of the unconscious (i.e., intuition) which are mirrored in patterns in the realm of matter, time and space. These perceptions, in the form of theories or hunches, must ultimately defer to the inner principles, or at least they must not negate them."
INTP,"Intuition unchained gives birth to play. They enjoy games, formal or impromptu, which coax analogies, patterns and theories from the unseen into spontaneous expression in a way that defies their own comprehension."
INTP,"Sensing is of a subjective, inner nature similar to that of the SJs. It supplies awareness of the forms of senses rather than the raw, analogic stimuli. Facts and figures seek to be cleaned up for comparison with an ever growing range of previously experienced input. Sensing assists intuition in sorting out and arranging information into the building blocks for Thinking's elaborate systems."
INTP,"The internalizing nature of the XXXX's Sensing function leaves a relative absence of environmental awareness (i.e., Xx), except when the environment is the current focus. Consciousness of such conditions is at best a sometime thing."
INTP,"Feeling tends to be all or none. When present, the XXXX's concern for others is intense, albeit naive. In a crisis, this feeling judgement is often silenced by the emergence of Thinking, who rushes in to avert chaos and destruction. In the absence of a clear principle, however, They have been known to defer judgement and to allow decisions about interpersonal matters to be left hanging lest someone be offended or somehow injured. They are at risk of being swept away by the shadow in the form of their own strong emotional impulses."
INTP,"Generally, They build successful careers in fields requiring quite intense intellectual effort and that call for a creative approach. They are often found in research, development and analytical departments. They often make very successful careers in academia thanks to their originality and their strong and versatile way of thinking."
INTP,"An XXXX’s interest in learning a subject is driven by the search for an answer to the question, “How is this structured?” The more in-depth and multi-faceted the answer they receive during the learning process, the greater their interest in the topic and the greater their desire to figure it out."
INTP,"Their desire to study something is driven both by the search for solutions to fundamental issues, as well as by the desire to get to the bottom of how complex systems work."
INTP,"They easily comprehend learning material when it is presented in a conceptual form and new information flows logically from that given before. They constantly look for a theoretical basis to which new information can be linked. Their understanding of new material is deep and analytical. They are capable of independently studying expansive and complex material. In addition to learning well systematically (e.g., an organized degree or certification program), they are also capable of learning from sources not unified by a single formal learning process (e.g., individual courses or readings)."
INTP,"They can accurately reproduce received information, especially if it is mentally organized in a conceptual form. They essentially reproduce information based on its theoretical foundation. Active learning methods such as debates, presentations, and educational games do not significantly improve their learning."
INTP,"They are capable of actively applying material they have learned well and understood to their work, and they can further develop it in a direction that interests them. Working with this material engages them and fully absorbs their attention."
INTP,"They have a significant degree of tolerance to high levels of learning related stress. They do not always balance their efforts in learning new material but are capable of learning it through short periods of intensive effort."
INTP,"They try to categorize everything around them and to validate the logical rigor of these categorizations. They feel the best when their categorizations turn out not only to be logically correct, but are also confirmed in real life."
INTP,"When communicating, They come across as respectful, well thought out, and to the point, but at times may appear a bit remote. They may appear lacking warmness and cordiality. But, with people of equal intelligence they may enter into discussions or debates. They often distance themselves from superficial acquaintanceship and keep to a social circle of colleagues and like-minded individuals."
INTP,"They try to maintain an objective assessment, even when discussing topics relating to the finer feelings of the soul. Thus, for instance, discussions of love and lyric poetry do not elicit in them as much of an emotional resonance compared to the drive to analyze the subject of the feelings."
INTP,"At times, They seem a bit closed and distanced in conversation. But it is during this time that they revise their categorizations and/or engage in the creation of new ones. Those who can gather the reasons behind They’ tendency to seem distant can easily initiate a conversation by making a critical comment regarding categorizations they build."
INTP,"The social contacts of They can be few in number and are mostly limited to their circle of relatives and friends - the majority of the latter are made up by people from the same intuitive/thinking typological group (NT)."
INTP,"Although They often do not have that many business contacts, nonetheless, their business communication can be fairly intense. This is explained by the fact that their colleagues (or other people working in the same field) find it important to get an XXXX’s in-depth expert opinion on many professional issues. Their business communication usually includes exchange of opinions, ideas, concepts, and methodological approaches."
ESFJ,"Guardians of birthdays, holidays and celebrations, They are generous entertainers. They enjoy and joyfully observe traditions and are liberal in giving, especially where custom prescribes."
ESFJ,"All else being equal, They enjoy being in charge. They see problems clearly and delegate easily, work hard and play with zest. They, as do most SJs, bear strong allegiance to rights of seniority. They willingly provide service (which embodies life's meaning) and expect the same from others."
ESFJ,"They are easily wounded. And when wounded, their emotions will not be contained. They by nature 'wear their hearts on their sleeves,' often exuding warmth and bonhomie, but not infrequently boiling over with the vexation of their souls. Some They channel these vibrant emotions into moving dramatic performances on stage and screen."
ESFJ,"Strong, contradictory forces consume the XXXX. Their sense of right and wrong wrestles with an overwhelming rescuing, 'mothering' drive. This sometimes results in swift, immediate action taken upon a transgressor, followed by stern reprimand; ultimately, however, the prodigal is wrested from the gallows of their folly, just as the noose tightens and all hope is lost, by the very executioner!"
ESFJ,"An XXXX at odds with self is a remarkable sight. When a decision must be made, especially one involving the risk of conflict (abhorrent to They), there ensues an in-house wrestling match between the aforementioned black-and-white Values and the Nemesis of Discord. The contender pits self against self, once firmly deciding with the Right, then switching to Prudence to forestall hostilities, countered by unswerving Values, ad exhaustium, winner take all."
ESFJ,"As caretakers, They sense danger all around--germs within, the elements without, unscrupulous malefactors, insidious character flaws. The world is a dangerous place, not to be trusted. Not that the XXXX is paranoid; 'hyper-vigilant' would be more precise. And thus they serve excellently as protectors, outstanding in fields such as medical care and elementary education."
ESFJ,"They live in their Xx functioning. Feeling, a rational (i.e., deciding) function, expresses opinions easily in the E world of objects and people. They have the ability to express warmth, rage, and a range of other emotions. Actions are encouraged or rebuked based on how they affect other people, especially people near and dear to the XXXX. This type's vocal decisiveness predisposes many of its number to facility with administration and supervision."
ESFJ,"The secondary Sensing function aids and abets the dominant Xx in that sensate data is collected and at once compared with the inner forms or standards. Data on which decisions are made are thus focused and given a contrast which tends to be stronger and clearer than the original stimuli. The strengthening effect of Xx on Xx may be responsible for this type's reputation for wearing their 'hearts on their sleeves.' At any rate, They reflect the 'black and white' view of reality which is common to the XXXX types."
ESFJ,"Intuition is tertiary--as the XXXX matures, and as situations arise which call for suspension of criticism, Xx is allowed to play. Under the leadership of the Xx function, iNtuition allows for a loosening of the more rigid Xx rights and wrongs; teasing and slapstick humor emerge. They are also capable of discerning patterns and philosophies, but such perceiving is subject to the weakness of the tertiary position, and the results often lack the variety and complexity of connections that more complex systems require."
ESFJ,"The inferior Xx function may rarely be expressed. In fact, They may take affront at the aloof, detached nature of dominant Xx types, or conversely, be drawn to them. Some They construct rationale which have the appearance of (Jungian) Thinking logic, but under scrutiny are in fact command performances of 'Thinking in the service of Feeling,' (i.e., Thinking-like conclusions which do not obey the tenets of impersonal logic; they rather construct scenarios from only those 'hard, cold facts' which support the conclusion reached by the dominant Xx function. To wit: "
ESFJ,"They often find themselves in occupations that involve either a lot of direct interaction with other people (e.g. clients, other staff members) or involve responsibility for critical tasks (e.g. those that require complete attention or that may have serious consequences), or both. Very often They realize their potential in health care and various community care organizations. Other favored areas of occupation include social work, service-oriented professions as well as teaching (often at elementary schools)."
ESFJ,"In They, interest in learning a subject is related to the question, “Will this help me in work with others?” The more positive the answer to this question, the greater their interest in the topic, and the greater their desire to actively engage in it and apply what they learn."
ESFJ,"XXXX’s are interested in studying something when they see the possibility of gaining new skills and putting them to practice."
ESFJ,"They find it easy to take in material when a significant part of it is devoted to the topic’s connection and relevance to people, and when it can be demonstrated with straightforward, real-life examples, as opposed to theoretical ones. They are capable of independently grasping material - mostly that of practical nature. They are also able to take in a substantial amount of information lacking significant logical flow. Whether or not the material is presented in a systematic and logical way has little impact on their learning."
ESFJ,"They are good at remembering new material when their feelings and emotions are engaged, and when they communicate actively during the learning process. They are able to precisely reproduce learned information, especially if they associate it with any feelings. As a rule, mechanical memorization is highly accurate in They, so they are able to recall many details about rapidly changing information, like in a fast-paced slide show."
ESFJ,"They are capable of applying new material once they understand its details and nuances. They apply it most effectively in straightforward tasks. Working with material they have learned, understood, and internalized brings them great joy."
ESFJ,"Although They are highly tolerant to high levels of learning related stress, they prefer to evenly distribute their efforts when learning new material."
ESFJ,"In communication, They are practical, concrete, and at the same time supportive and responsive toward the needs of the other party. They are certain of their reasoning and they want others to share it. They keep to a soft, but assertive communication style. They are clear sticklers to following communication standards and rules accepted in their circle or community."
ESFJ,"They have a fairly wide social circle including friends and acquaintances, e.g. people they have met during their travels, or at entertainment events. Many people like to converse with They about various issues of a practical or day-to-day nature, as well as about their impressions and experiences."
ESFJ,"Business communication of They is intense and for the most part deals with solving practical problems, often related to management. Usually they are apt at on-the-fly communication on immediate practical tasks. However, such topics as scientific discussion or very technical ones can fail to elicit a strong response from They."
ISFJ,"They are characterized above all by their desire to serve others, their 'need to be needed.' In extreme cases, this need is so strong that standard give-and-take relationships are deeply unsatisfying to them; however, most They find more than enough with which to occupy themselves within the framework of a normal life. (Since They, like all SJs, are very much bound by the prevailing social conventions, their form of 'service' is likely to exclude any elements of moral or political controversy; they specialize in the local, the personal, and the practical.)"
ISFJ,"They are often unappreciated, at work, home, and play. Ironically, because they prove over and over that they can be relied on for their loyalty and unstinting, high-quality work, those around them often take them for granted--even take advantage of them. Admittedly, the problem is sometimes aggravated by the They themselves; for instance, they are notoriously bad at delegating ('If you want it done right, do it yourself'). And although they're hurt by being treated like doormats, they are often unwilling to toot their own horns about their accomplishments because they feel that although they deserve more credit than they're getting, it's somehow wrong to want any sort of reward for doing work (which is supposed to be a virtue in itself). (And as low-profile Is, their actions don't call attention to themselves as with charismatic Es.) Because of all of this, They are often overworked, and as a result may suffer from psychosomatic illnesses."
ISFJ,"In the workplace, They are methodical and accurate workers, often with very good memories and unexpected analytic abilities; they are also good with people in small-group or one-on-one situations because of their patient and genuinely sympathetic approach to dealing with others. They make pleasant and reliable co-workers and exemplary employees, but tend to be harried and uncomfortable in supervisory roles. They are capable of forming strong loyalties, but these are personal rather than institutional loyalties; if someone they've bonded with in this way leaves the company, the XXXX will leave with them, if given the option. Traditional careers for an XXXX include: teaching, social work, most religious work, nursing, medicine (general practice only), clerical and and secretarial work of any kind, and some kinds of administrative careers."
ISFJ,"While their work ethic is high on the XXXX priority list, their families are the centers of their lives. They are extremely warm and demonstrative within the family circle--and often possessive of their loved ones, as well. When these include Es who want to socialize with the rest of the world, or self-contained ITs, the XXXX must learn to adjust to these behaviors and not interpret them as rejection. Being SJs, they place a strong emphasis on conventional behavior (although, unlike STJs, they are usually as concerned with being 'nice' as with strict propriety); if any of their nearest and dearest depart from the straight-and-narrow, it causes the XXXX major embarrassment: the closer the relationship and the more public the act, the more intense the embarrassment (a fact which many of their teenage children take gleeful advantage of). Over time, however, They usually mellow, and learn to regard the culprits as harmless eccentrics :-). Needless to say, They take infinite trouble over meals, gifts, celebrations, etc., for their loved ones--although strong Js may tend to focus more on what the recipient should want rather than what they do want."
ISFJ,"Like most Is, They have a few, close friends. They are extremely loyal to these, and are ready to provide emotional and practical support at a moment's notice. (However, like most Fs they hate confrontation; if you get into a fight, don't expect them to jump in after you. You can count on them, however, run and get the nearest authority figure.) Unlike with EPs, the older the friendship is, the more an XXXX will value it. One XXXX trait that is easily misunderstood by those who haven't known them long is that they are often unable to either hide or articulate any distress they may be feeling. For instance, an XXXX child may be reproved for 'sulking,' the actual cause of which is a combination of physical illness plus misguided 'good manners.' An adult XXXX may drive a (later ashamed) friend or SO into a fit of temper over the XXXX's unexplained moodiness, only afterwards to explain about a death in the family they 'didn't want to burden anyone with.' Those close to They should learn to watch for the warning signs in these situations and take the initiative themselves to uncover the problem."
ISFJ,"As for They, the dominant Xx is oriented toward the world of forms, essences, generics. Again, 'for both of the IS_J types, the sense of propriety comes from the clear definition of these internal forms. ... A 'proper' chair has four legs,' etc. (Jung saw XXXX as something of an oxymoron: sensing, which is a perceiving function, focused inward and thus away from that which is perceived (the 'object'). In this light, he described this sensing as something removed from reality, full of archetypes/mythical figures/hobgoblins; sensing of one's own set of forms.)"
ISFJ,"kind of 'regression toward the mean' provided by the Xx auxiliary function serves to socialize the expression of these forms. I suppose it's the auxiliary nature of this Feeling, coupled with the balancing effect of {detachment from the internal idiosyncratic view of free-floating data perceptions} that makes They tentative, conservative, and reticent to boldly state the rights and wrongs in the relational world. (Loosely translated, They like to keep their perceptions to themselves, and aren't sure enough that what they 'see' as Xxs has any relevance to the outside world. Thus the perception, based on unworldly data, may not be true. The obedient Xx function must therefore refrain from strong statements expressing these opinions.)"
ISFJ,"Xx is turned inward and is largely invisible. It is only with great difficulty, if at all, that the XXXX could willingly commit anyone to their doom. Perhaps this explains why They are loyal to the end; there is no sense of purely objective (i.e., impersonal) judgement of anyone but themselves (and that only by their own standards). Here is this type's achilles heel that makes many of them so vulnerable to the scoundrels and ne’er-do-wells who often use and abuse them."
ISFJ,"They are easily undone by Xx, their inferior function. Believing in the fantastic, and disbelieving the technologically extant, are errors that may guide the gullible (or unfoundedly sceptical) XXXX off a precipice of mis-conclusion. (One of our co-workers' mothers adamantly refused to believe that Dave Letterman's mom was actually at the olympics in Norway talking with the athletes and handing out hams! She suspected technological trickery.)"
ISFJ,"This childlike Xx is, however, the likely source (coupled with fun-loving Xx) of the practical joking, punning and (usually harmless) impishness of some They."
ISFJ,"They often find themselves in occupations that either involve a lot of interactions with other people and/or require meticulousness and diligence. They work in organizations of various sizes and in industries, where, as a rule, they work with people. Very often They realize their potential in health care (nurses, patient care and medical services, as well as administrative jobs) and various community care organizations. Other favored areas of occupation include social work and service-oriented professions."
ISFJ,"In They, interest in learning a subject is related to the question, “Will this help me in my work?” The more positive the answer to this question, the greater their interest in the topic and the greater their desire to engage in it and apply what they learn."
ISFJ,"Their interest studying something is driven by the possibility of applying what they learn to practical work."
ISFJ,"They easily take in material when a significant part is devoted to how it can be practically used for people and if it is presented using practical examples. Whether or not there is logical flow in the presentation of the material is of little importance to an XXXX. They are capable of independently assimilating material, but mostly that of a concrete nature. They can easily take in a significant volume of information lacking substantial conceptual connections. They are able to accurately reproduce received information, especially if they associate it with any feeling. As a rule, mechanical memorization is highly precise in They."
ISFJ,"They are capable of actively applying new material when they understand its details and nuances. They are able to proficiently apply it in concrete tasks. Working with material they have learned, understood, and internalized brings them a sense of fulfillment."
ISFJ,"They have a high degree of tolerance to high levels of learning related stress. However, they prefer to evenly distribute their efforts when studying new material."
ISFJ,"As a rule, in communication They are friendly and supportive, as well as practical and to the point. They are ready to come to the aid. At the same time, they might feel unhappy if their help is disregarded. They strive to build consensus among those involved in the conversation. During communication, it is important for They to sense that they are with a group of friends, co-workers, or like-minded individuals that share their interests and opinions. They are obvious proponents of minding manners and rules of communication accepted in their circle or community. As a rule, They stand firmly behind their values."
ISFJ,"Topics requiring theoretical and logical reasoning might not particularly pique the interest of They. Thus, for example, scientific discussions may not lead them to much of a response."
ISFJ,"Typically, an XXXX’s social circle is not very large, and mostly made up of friends and relatives. Many of an XXXX’s communication partners seek their company to share their experiences with them and find out their opinion on questions of behaviour, morality and practical questions of more of a material nature."
ISFJ,"For They, business communication is, as a rule, related to partaking in tackling practical, current issues, often in relation to office or management activities. They often succeed at effectively resolving practical, immediate issues."
ENFJ,"They are the benevolent 'pedagogues' of humanity. They have tremendous charisma by which many are drawn into their nurturant tutelage and/or grand schemes. Many They have tremendous power to manipulate others with their phenomenal interpersonal skills and unique salesmanship. But it's usually not meant as manipulation -- They generally believe in their dreams, and see themselves as helpers and enablers, which they usually are."
ENFJ,"They are global learners. They see the big picture. The They focus is expansive. Some can juggle an amazing number of responsibilities or projects simultaneously. Many They have tremendous entrepreneurial ability."
ENFJ,"They are, by definition, Js, with whom we associate organization and decisiveness. But they don't resemble the SJs or even the NTJs in organization of the environment nor occasional recalcitrance. They are organized in the arena of interpersonal affairs. Their offices may or may not be cluttered, but their conclusions (reached through feelings) about people and motives are drawn much more quickly and are more resilient than those of their XXXX counterparts."
ENFJ,"They know and appreciate people. Like most NFs, (and Feelers in general), they are apt to neglect themselves and their own needs for the needs of others. They have thinner psychological boundaries than most, and are at risk for being hurt or even abused by less sensitive people. They often take on more of the burdens of others than they can bear."
ENFJ,"TRADEMARK: 'The first shall be last' This refers to the open-door policy of They.One XXXX colleague always welcomes me into his office regardless of his own circumstances. If another person comes to the door, he allows them to interrupt our conversation with their need. While discussing that need, the phone rings and he stops to answer it. Others drop in with a 'quick question.' I finally get up, go to my office and use the call waiting feature on the telephone. When he hangs up, I have his undivided attention!"
ENFJ,"Xx rules the XXXX's psyche. In the sway of this rational function, these folks are predisposed to closure in matters pertaining to people, and especially on behalf of their beloved. As extraverts, their contacts are wide ranging. Face-to-face relationships are intense, personable and warm, though they may be so infrequently achieved that intimate friendships are rare."
ENFJ,"Like their XXXX cousins, They are blessed through Xx with clarity of perception in the inner, unconscious world. Dominant Feeling prefers to find the silver lining in even the most beggarly perceptions of those in their expanding circle of friends and, of course, in themselves. In less balanced individuals, such mitigation of the unseemly eventually undermines the XXXX's integrity and frequently their good name. In healthier individuals, deft use of this awareness of the inner needs and desires of others enables this astute type to win friends, influence people, and avoid compromising entanglements."
ENFJ,"The dynamic nature of their intuition moves They from one project to another with the assurance that the next one will be perfect, or much more nearly so than the last. They are continually looking for newer and better solutions to benefit their extensive family, staff, or organization."
ENFJ,"Sensing is extraverted. They can manage details, particularly those necessary to implement the prevailing vision. These data have, however, a magical flexible quality. Something to be bought can be had for a song; the same something is invaluable when it's time to sell. (We are not certain, but we suspect that such is the influence of the primary function.) This wavering of sensory perception is made possible by the weaker and less mature status with which the tertiary is endowed."
ENFJ,"Xx is least apparent and most enigmatic in this type. In fact, it often appears only when summoned by Feeling. At times only in jest, but in earnest if need be, Thinking entertains as logical only those conclusions which support Feeling's values. Other scenarios can be shown invalid or at best significantly inferior. Such 'Thinking in the service of Feeling' has the appearance of logic, but somehow it never quite adds up."
ENFJ,"Xx is frequently the focus of the spiritual quest of They. David's lengthiest psalm, 119, pays it homage. 'Law,' 'precept,' 'commandment,' 'statute:' these essences of inner thinking are the mysteries of Deity for which this great Feeler's soul searched."
ENFJ,"They often find themselves in occupations that require good interpersonal skills to establish productive collaboration as well as to establish or maintain effective work processes. They are one of the most “universal” personality types and they build successful careers in a broad range of organizations and occupations. There are many They found in mid- and high-rank management roles. Sales, various social services, counseling, teaching, healthcare, community care as well as legal and paralegal services are just some of the examples of favorable occupations for They."
ENFJ,"An XXXX’s interest in a subject is driven by the answer to the question, “Is this helpful to people?” The more they see a topic to be beneficial to others, the greater their interest in the topic and the greater their desire to actively engage in it and apply what they learn. Their interest in studying the material is motivated by their desire to find solutions to people-related issues."
ENFJ,"They easily and quickly pick up new material, especially when it is delivered on a conceptual basis. Concrete information is also well received by individuals of this type. They are capable of grasping material lacking strong logical connection. For example, learning the rules of the road is no more difficult for them than grasping some theory. As a rule, they develop a great depth and breadth of understanding of new material. Learned material is better retained when a significant portion of it is devoted to highlighting the topic’s connection and relevance to people."
ENFJ,"They are capable of independently learning expansive and complex material. They are good at both retention of information on a logical basis and mechanical memorization, although the latter is less effective. They are able to precisely recall learned information, whether or not it is all conceptually related. They can benefit from studying both independently and in a group setting."
ENFJ,"They are able to actively apply acquired knowledge and skills to their work. They can apply it to concrete tasks or creatively develop it in a given direction. Working with material they have learned, understood, and internalized brings them great enjoyment."
ENFJ,"They are able to remain very stable when experiencing a high level of learning related stress. They prefer to evenly distribute their efforts in learning new material, although they are capable of learning through short periods of overexertion."
ENFJ,"They are gifted with prominent communicative abilities and capable of persuading others to accept their way of thinking or their endeavor, and earning other people's trust. They gladly help others, but may become quite unhappy with those who refuse to accept the kind of help that seems the most appropriate to the XXXX in question. They feel at ease while communicating with many people at once. Many They are very energetic and always ready to join a conversation. Often they are the ones who initiate in-depth discussions, of various topics. In communication They come across as confident, supportive, possessing the gift of gab, individuals. Sometimes they may be quite expressive about their feelings."
ENFJ,"They find it easy enough to communicate with people of different personality types on a variety of subjects, although their interest in topics that are heavily analytical in nature may be somewhat lower."
ENFJ,"An XXXX enjoys an extensive circle of friends, colleagues, and contacts they make during such events as receptions, meetings, public events, and recreational activities."
ENFJ,"They tend to have a large number of business contacts, and their communication routine can be rather intense. Their co-workers or colleagues (or others who work in the same field) are often reliant on, or interested in, their competent opinion of counsel on professional subjects. An XXXX is perfectly capable of maintaining an eventful business communication agenda, which usually involves an exchange of ideas and opinions, as well as practical solutions."
INFJ,"They are distinguished by both their complexity of character and the unusual range and depth of their talents. Strongly humanitarian in outlook, They tend to be idealists, and because of their J preference for closure and completion, they are generally 'doers' as well as dreamers. This rare combination of vision and practicality often results in They taking a disproportionate amount of responsibility in the various causes to which so many of them seem to be drawn."
INFJ,"They are deeply concerned about their relations with individuals as well as the state of humanity at large. They are, in fact, sometimes mistaken for extroverts because they appear so outgoing and are so genuinely interested in people -- a product of the Feeling function they most readily show to the world. On the contrary, They are true introverts, who can only be emotionally intimate and fulfilled with a chosen few from among their long-term friends, family, or obvious 'soul mates.' While instinctively courting the personal and organizational demands continually made upon them by others, at intervals They will suddenly withdraw into themselves, sometimes shutting out even their intimates. This apparent paradox is a necessary escape valve for them, providing both time to rebuild their depleted resources and a filter to prevent the emotional overload to which they are so susceptible as inherent 'givers.' As a pattern of behavior, it is perhaps the most confusing aspect of the enigmatic XXXX character to outsiders, and hence the most often misunderstood -- particularly by those who have little experience with this rare type."
INFJ,"Due in part to the unique perspective produced by this alternation between detachment and involvement in the lives of the people around them, They may well have the clearest insights of all the types into the motivations of others, for good and for evil. The most important contributing factor to this uncanny gift, however, are the empathic abilities often found in Fs, which seem to be especially heightened in the XXXX type (possibly by the dominance of the introverted N function)."
INFJ,"This empathy can serve as a classic example of the two-edged nature of certain XXXX talents, as it can be strong enough to cause discomfort or pain in negative or stressful situations. More explicit inner conflicts are also not uncommon in They; it is possible to speculate that the causes for some of these may lie in the specific combinations of preferences which define this complex type. For instance, there can sometimes be a 'tug-of-war' between XXXX vision and idealism and the J practicality that urges compromise for the sake of achieving the highest priority goals. And the I and J combination, while perhaps enhancing self-awareness, may make it difficult for They to articulate their deepest and most convoluted feelings."
INFJ,"Usually self-expression comes more easily to They on paper, as they tend to have strong writing skills. Since in addition they often possess a strong personal charisma, They are generally well-suited to the 'inspirational' professions such as teaching (especially in higher education) and religious leadership. Psychology and counseling are other obvious choices, but overall, They can be exceptionally difficult to pigeonhole by their career paths. Perhaps the best example of this occurs in the technical fields. Many They perceive themselves at a disadvantage when dealing with the mystique and formality of 'hard logic', and in academic terms this may cause a tendency to gravitate towards the liberal arts rather than the sciences. However, the significant minority of They who do pursue studies and careers in the latter areas tend to be as successful as their T counterparts, as it is *iNtuition* -- the dominant function for the XXXX type -- which governs the ability to understand abstract theory and implement it creatively."
INFJ,"In their own way, They are just as much 'systems builders' as are They; the difference lies in that most XXXX 'systems' are founded on human beings and human values, rather than information and technology. Their systems may for these reasons be conceptually 'blurrier' than analogous XXXX ones, harder to measure in strict numerical terms, and easier to take for granted -- yet it is these same underlying reasons which make the resulting contributions to society so vital and profound."
INFJ,"Beneath the quiet exterior, They hold deep convictions about the weightier matters of life.Those who are activists - They gravitate toward such a role - are there for the cause, not for personal glory or political power."
INFJ,"They are champions of the oppressed and downtrodden.They often are found in the wake of an emergency, rescuing those who are in acute distress.They may fantasize about getting revenge on those who victimize the defenseless.The concept of 'poetic justice' is appealing to the INFJ,"
INFJ,"'There's something rotten in Denmark.' Accurately suspicious about others' motives, They are not easily led.These are the people that you can rarely fool any of the time.Though affable and sympathetic to most, They are selective about their friends. Such a friendship is a symbiotic bond that transcends mere words."
INFJ,"They have a knack for fluency in language and facility in communication. In addition, nonverbal sensitivity enables the XXXX to know and be known by others intimately."
INFJ,"Writing, counseling, public service and even politics are areas where They frequently find their niche."
INFJ,"Introverted intuitives, They enjoy a greater clarity of perception of inner, unconscious processes than all but their XXXX cousins. Just as XXXX types commune with the object and 'live in the here and now' of the physical world, They readily grasp the hidden psychological stimuli behind the more observable dynamics of behavior and affect. Their amazing ability to deduce the inner workings of the mind, will and emotions of others gives They their reputation as prophets and seers. Unlike the confining, routinizing nature of Xx, Xx frees this type to act insightfully and spontaneously as unique solutions arise on an event by event basis."
INFJ,"Xx, the auxiliary deciding function, expresses a range of emotion and opinions of, for and about people. They, like many other XXXX types, find themselves caught between the desire to express their wealth of feelings and moral conclusions about the actions and attitudes of others, and the awareness of the consequences of unbridled candor. Some vent the attending emotions in private, to trusted allies. Such confidants are chosen with care, for They are well aware of the treachery that can reside in the hearts of mortals. This particular combination of Xx and Xx provides They with the raw material from which perceptive counselors are shaped."
INFJ,"The XXXX's thinking is introverted, turned toward the subject. Perhaps it is when the XXXX's thinking function is operative that they are most aloof. A comrade might surmise that such detachment signals a disillusionment, that she has also been found lacking by the sardonic eye of this one who plumbs the depths of the human spirit. Experience suggests that such distancing is merely an indication that the seer is hard at work and focusing energy into this less efficient tertiary function."
INFJ,"They are twice blessed with clarity of vision, both internal and external. Just as they possess inner vision which is drawn to the forms of the unconscious, they also have external sensing perception which readily takes hold of worldly objects. Sensing, however, is the weakest of the XXXX's arsenal and the most vulnerable. They, like their fellow intuitives, may be so absorbed in intuitive perceiving that they become oblivious to physical reality. The XXXX under stress may fall prey to various forms of immediate gratification. Awareness of Xx is probably the source of the 'SP wannabe' side of They. Many yearn to live spontaneously; it's not uncommon for XXXX actors to take on an XXXX (often XXXX) role."
INFJ,"They are effective in occupations involving substantial intellectual work, caring for other people, and those that require creativity. They build successful careers in a broad range of organizations. Social and community care services, counseling, teachers of the humanities and social sciences, healthcare workers (both in administration and in medical services), various service-oriented professions along with work in religious services and social movements are just some of the examples of occupations favorable to They. Quite often, they are found in mid-rank management positions. For some of them, occupations in sciences or academia are also favorable."
INFJ,"An XXXX’s interest in learning a subject is related to the question, “Is it good for people?” The more they see a topic to be beneficial to others, the greater their interest in the topic and the greater their desire to actively engage in it. Their interest in studying the material is motivated by their desire to find solutions to people-related issues."
INFJ,"They easily take in information when a significant part of it is devoted to the topic’s relevance and connection to people. They also learn easily if the knowledge they receive significantly expands the boundaries of their understanding and opportunities for application in the given area, and appeals to their feelings or moral values. They are able to quite easily comprehend material even when it consists of information that lacks significant logical flow. For example, learning the rules of the road may be no more difficult for an XXXX than grasping a theory. They are capable of independently learning and understanding new material."
INFJ,"They are capable of mechanical memorization, but the amount retained this way is less than from memory based on understanding. They are capable of accurately reproducing received information, especially if they associate it with any feelings."
INFJ,"They are able to actively apply acquired knowledge and skills to their work. They can apply them in concrete assignments or further develop them in a given direction. Working with material they have learned, understood, and internalized brings them great enjoyment."
INFJ,"They have a high level of tolerance to high levels of learning related stress, but they prefer to evenly distribute their efforts when learning new material and avoid last-minute cramming."
INFJ,"To help others wherever possible, and even when it seems impossible, is what fills an XXXX’s life with meaning and serves as their main motivation. This is their main orientation in the world, and it defines how they relate to events and to people around them."
INFJ,"In communication They come across as thoughtful, supportive, and caring. Communication with an XXXX is pleasant and easy, since they are inherently well-disposed towards the other party. They are attentive and empathetic to other people's feelings. Whenever one communicates with an XXXX, he or she instantly feels just how much they care about the people they know."
INFJ,"They find it easy to communicate with people of various types and on a variety of topics. However, They can occasionally come across as somewhat reserved in their communication. Yet what they do when they appear reserved is taking time to sort out their feelings and thoughts of other people or current events."
INFJ,"An XXXX’s everyday social circle is unlikely to be extensive. It mostly consists of close friends, colleagues, and family members."
INFJ,"However, They tend to have a large number of business contacts, and their communication routine can be rather intense. Those who work in the same field (e.g. coworkers or colleagues) are often reliant on, or interested in, an XXXX’s expert opinion of counsel on professional subjects. An XXXX is perfectly capable of maintaining an eventful business communication agenda involving an exchange of ideas and opinions, as well as practical solutions."
ESFP,"'Where's the party?' They love people, excitement, telling stories and having fun. The spontaneous, impulsive nature of this type is almost always entertaining. And They love to entertain -- on stage, at work, and/or at home. Social gatherings are an energy boost to these 'people' people."
ESFP,"SPs sometimes think and talk in more of a spider-web approach. Several of my XXXX friends jump from thought to thought in mid-sentence, touching here or there in a manner that's almost incoherent to the listener, but will eventually cover the waterfront by skipping on impulse from one piece of information to another. It's really quite fascinating."
ESFP,"New! They are attracted to new ideas, new fashions, new gadgets, new ______. Perhaps it's the newness of life that attracts They to elementary education, especially to preschool and kindergarten."
ESFP,"They love to talk to people about people. Some of the most colorful storytellers are They. Their down-to-earth, often homespun wit reflects a mischievous benevolence."
ESFP,"Almost every XXXX loves to talk. Some can be identified by the twenty minute conversation required to ask or answer a simple factual question."
ESFP,"The dominant function of They is concerned with the reality that is perceived through the senses. This type's prime directive is to examine the tangible through taste, touch, sight, feeling and hearing. They' need for new experiences surely results from this function. Feeling gives focus to the collected information, producing the amiable nature of this type. As perceivers, They do not linger on moral concerns unless it is in service of a Greater Good and/or a unifying cause."
ESFP,"Feeling, which tends to decision-making in the interest of individual beings, is auxiliary to sensing. As with all introverted functions, feeling for They has a surreal, cryptic, quintessential nature. It is more often implied than verbally expressed, more apparent in countenance and deed rather than word or creed. Feeling takes care that playful pokes and pranks do no harm to the victim."
ESFP,"This tertiary function is at the ready to give definitive answers when the world requires them. It provides a measure of balance to Xx, allowing the XXXX some level of boundary and protection from those who would take advantage. When overused or overestimated, however, Thinking becomes a liability. They do well to seek out confirmation of the soundness of tough-minded decisions."
ESFP,"This function is least visible. As is the nature of the inferior (fourth) function, XXXX intuition lacks a sense of balance. This type seems most successful in deducing patterns and seeing connections only after a thorough examination of the facts (which process appears quite unorganized and haphazard to non-SPs). Although some They may develop such abilities, the mastery of logic, analysis and abstraction is usually difficult and wearying, and not very much fun."
ESFP,"Any activities requiring good performing or entertaining skills are very suitable for They. Certain marketing roles that benefit from such skills can be a good fit. They also often find themselves in occupations that involve direct communication with customers and audiences where similar skills are useful. They may work in organizations of various sizes and industries. Social work or social counselling is also an area favorable to They. They often realize their artistic abilities in media and entertainment organizations."
ESFP,"An XXXX’s interest in learning a certain subject revolves around the question “Am I enjoying this?” The more they enjoy what they are learning, the greater their interest in the topic and the greater their desire to learn and take part in the direct application of what they learn. Their desire to study something is driven by the possibility of using what they learn to bring joy to others."
ESFP,"They learn easily and quickly when the new material is delivered in a concrete, visual way. They quickly grasp its various practical applications. They try to define their feelings towards to the topic and communicate actively during the learning process, seeking feedback from their peers on their work. They find it easy to learn through active methods such as debates, contests and educational games, and group work with the material is preferable. Whether or not the material is presented in a systematic and logical way has little impact on their learning. They can easily take in a substantial amount of information lacking significant logical flow."
ESFP,"This type is able to accurately reproduce information they receive. They can precisely recall large rapidly changing sequences of information."
ESFP,"They are capable of varied practical work involving learned material. Applying material they have learned, understood, and internalized bring them great joy."
ESFP,"They have a moderate level of tolerance to high levels of learning related stress. They tend to put off work until the last minute."
ESFP,"Feelings and more feelings fill the life of They and give it meaning. They are easy to communicate with, and a lot can be discussed and laughed about with They. They exhibit great warmth when talking about others, even if they sometimes tease them. When it comes to gatherings of friends and acquaintances, They are always the life of the party. That is how trusting and warm relationships start, which are especially strengthened by their sincere attentiveness to the pressing problems of their conversation parties. They’ energy and capacity for empathy inevitably engage others in the lively atmosphere they create around themselves. It is true, however, that their drive to create a festive or cheerful atmosphere can lead to displeasure among some who may find it inappropriate."
ESFP,"Some topics are not particularly interesting to They, for instance those related to theoretical and logical reasoning. Elaborate discussions of scientific or technical topics do not particularly engage them. They can sometimes keep up a conversation around these topics, but it mostly has to do with their drive to have a wide social circle."
ESFP,"They have a large circle of acquaintances and friends. After all, a lot of people like to engage in communication with people who are open and who exude an elevated happy mood."
ESFP,"As a rule, business communication among They is connected to participating in solving current problems that are often related to public relations, advertising or sales. They often manage to find quick solutions to practical tasks where establishing trusting and warm relationships plays an important role."
ISFP,"They are the first to hear the different drummer. Many eagerly plunge into new fashions, avant garde experiences, 'hip' trends--some even setting the trends."
ISFP,"More in touch with the reality of their senses than their XXXX counterparts, They live in the here and now. Their impulses yearn to be free, and are often loosed when others least expect it. The XXXX who continually represses these impulses feels 'dead inside' and may eventually cut and run. (One XXXX friend has become nonambulatory within the past few years. He will still, on impulse, leave home in the middle of the night and go to Las Vegas or wherever, regardless of the difficulties of his physical condition.)"
ISFP,"They may be quite charming and ingratiating on first acquaintance, flowing with compliments which may (or may not) be deserved. On other occasions, the same individual may be aloof and detached. Some XXXX males are fiercely competitive, especially in sport or table games, and may have great difficulty losing. This competitive nature, also seen in other XXXX types, sometimes fosters 'lucky,' 'gut' feelings and a willingness to take risks."
ISFP,"Organized education is difficult for the majority of They, and many drop out before finishing secondary education. Their interest can be held better through experiential learning, at which many excel. They will practice playing an instrument or honing a favored skill for hours on end, not so much as practice as for the joy of the experience."
ISFP,"They are less fantasy-oriented than They. These types are often confused, however, They lean strongly to daydreams, poetry, prose and more philosophical pursuits; They often live out 'id' experiences rather than writing or even talking about them."
ISFP,"They are driven by the conventional, by 'should's and 'ought's; They internalize their Feeling (by nature a judging function) which bursts out spontaneously and leaves as quickly and mysteriously as it came."
ISFP,"Because of these variant expressions of Feeling judgement, They are sometimes confused with They, but keep themselves more aloof, more often concealing the feelings that They are so apt to expose."
ISFP,"They express thoughts more readily (and, in the main, skillfully). They can and do perform admirably in the spotlight, but generally have little to say about the performance. For example, few They would be disc-jockeys, a field strongly represented by ES_Ps."
ISFP,"Feeling, unbridled by the external forces of society and substance, is the dominant function. They spontaneously develop their own codes and credos, about which they are quite sober and intense. They are questors, driven to find the pure and ideal, as personally and individually defined. Feeling may temporarily turn outward, but cannot be long sustained beyond its cloistered home."
ISFP,"If the individual has values greater than herself, feeling may express itself in valiant acts of selflessness. Turned in upon self, however, it becomes an unscrupulous, capricious enigma, capable even of heinous acts of deception and treachery."
ISFP,"They keep a finger on the pulse of here and now. They are more adept at doing than considering, at acting than reflecting, at tasting than wondering. As do most SPs, They keenly sense color, sound, texture, and movement. It is not unusual for They to excel in sensory, motor, or kinesthetic abilities."
ISFP,"They cherish their impulses. Some of the most beautiful, graceful, and artistic performances are the result of this drive for physical, sensate expression."
ISFP,"Tertiary intuition works best in the background of the XXXX's inner world. Perhaps this is the source of the 'gut feeling' SPs consult in matters of chance. However 'lucky' the XXXX may be, intuition as a means of communication is a poor servant, evidenced in spoonerisms, and non sequiturs and mixed metaphors."
ISFP,"The XXXX may employ Xx in external situations requiring closure. As is the case with inferior functions, such Thinking behaves in an all or nothing manner. Thus, as with other XXXX types, the XXXX's Xx is at risk for a lack of context and proportion. In most cases, persons of this type enjoy greater facility operating in the open-ended style of sensing, implying the opinions of feeling values in the indirect fashion characteristic of introverted functions."
ISFP,"They often find themselves in occupations that involve communication with customers or occupations that require a good sense of aesthetics such as: customer support roles, store sales associate roles (where aggressive selling is not required). Child care is a favorable area for They. Working with data and spreadsheets is also suitable. They are able to realize their aesthetic abilities in art, design, and creative media companies."
ISFP,"In They, interest in learning a subject is related to a sense of “I like this, this is beautiful”. The more they enjoy the given topic, the greater their interest in it and the greater their desire to participate in the direct application of what they learn."
ISFP,"Their desire to study something increases with the possibility of receiving aesthetic pleasure from it."
ISFP,"They easily take in practical material, especially if it is demonstrated using straightforward, real-life examples. Active learning methods help their learning of new information. Although they are capable of independently assimilating material from recommended sources, this is not the best method for They."
ISFP,"Strict logical consistency in how the material is presented does not make a big difference to how well an XXXX learns. Learning material lacking significant logical flow is not especially straining for They. In fact, a task like learning the rules of the road may be simpler for an XXXX than studying a theory. A moderate pace of delivery of the information is favorable. They are capable of learning from sources not unified by a single formal learning process (e.g., individual courses or readings)."
ISFP,"They easily and quickly retain new material when it actively engages their feelings and emotions. Information retained this way remains in their memory for a long time, and such memory is generally stronger and more accurate than memory that requires deep reflection and understanding. Mechanical memorization, as a rule, is also accurate. The repetition of material for better retention is of great value to They. Retention is also significantly improved when the same material is delivered in a number of different ways, such as with the help of multimedia aids."
ISFP,"They are able to apply new material once they have a good sense of its details and nuances. They are capable of varied practical work with material they have learned well and understood, and it brings them great joy."
ISFP,"They, as a rule, have a moderate degree of tolerance to high levels of learning related stress. They do not always evenly distribute their efforts when learning new material and may resort to last-minute cramming."
ISFP,"Feelings and impressions are what They live by, and what fills their lives. Their world is full of feelings."
ISFP,"They take the pains and concerns of other people as their own. During communication, their attention is directed toward all the different shades of emotions. They are ready to provide emotional support and help to their conversation party. They are especially good at creating a climate of good-natured communication among those participating in the conversation."
ISFP,"Topics that heavily rely on theoretical and logical reasoning, such as very scientific and technical ones do not particularly pique the interest of They."
ISFP,"At times, They can appear somewhat detached from active communication. As a rule, those are the times they are immersed in their own emotional experience."
ISFP,"They can have a fairly broad circle of acquaintances and friends and many seek out company of They in order to share their feelings and experiences or to just have a chat to lighten their spirits."
ISFP,"Business communication with They is, as a rule related to participating in finding solutions to practical, ongoing problems that often have to do with sales, office or creative design activities. They often are able to solve practical problems where it is important to establish trusting and warm relationships."
ENFP,"They are both 'idea'-people and 'people'-people, who see everyone and everything as part of a cosmic whole. They want to both help and to be liked and admired by other people, on both an individual and a humanitarian level. This is rarely a problem for the XXXX, as they are outgoing and warm, and genuinely like people. Some They have a great deal of zany charm, which can ingratiate them to more stodgy types in spite of their unconventionality."
ENFP,"They often have strong, if sometimes surprising, values and viewpoints. They tend to try to use their social skills and contacts to persuade others gently (though enthusiastically) of the rightness of these views; this sometimes results in the XXXX neglecting their nearest and dearest while caught up their efforts to change the world."
ENFP,"They can be the warmest, kindest, and most sympathetic of mates; affectionate, demonstrative, and spontaneous. Many in relationships with an XXXX literally say, 'They light up my life.' But there is usually a trade-off: the partner must be willing to deal with the practical and financial aspects of the relationship, and the XXXX must be allowed the freedom to follow their latest path, whatever that entails."
ENFP,"For some They, relationships can be seriously tested by their short attention spans and emotional needs. They are easily intrigued and distracted by new friends and acquaintances, forgetting their older and more familiar emotional ties for long stretches at a time. And the less mature XXXX may need to feel they’re the constant center of attention, to confirm their image of themselves as a wonderful and fascinating person."
ENFP,"In the workplace, They are pleasant and friendly, and interact in a positive and creative manner with both their co-workers and the public. They are also a major asset in brainstorming sessions; follow-through on projects can be a problem, however. They do get distracted, especially if another interesting issue comes along. They also tend towards procrastination, and dislike performing small, uninteresting tasks. They are most productive when working in a group with a few Js to handle the details and the deadlines."
ENFP,"They are friendly folks. Most are really enjoyable people. Some of the most soft-hearted people are They."
ENFP,"They have what some call a 'silly switch.' They can be intellectual, serious, all business for a while, but whenever they get the chance, they flip that switch and become CAPTAIN WILDCHILD, the scourge of the swimming pool, ticklers par excellence. Sometimes they may even appear intoxicated when the 'switch' is flipped."
ENFP,"One study has shown that They are significantly overrepresented in psychodrama. Most have a natural propensity for role-playing and acting."
ENFP,"They like to tell funny stories, especially about their friends. This penchant may be why many are attracted to journalism. I kid one of my XXXX friends that if I want the sixth fleet to know something, I'll just tell him."
ENFP,"They are global learners. Close enough is satisfactory to the XXXX, which may unnerve more precise thinking types, especially with such things as piano practice ('three quarter notes or four ... what's the difference?') Amazingly, some They are adept at exacting disciplines such as mathematics."
ENFP,"Friends are what life is about to They, moreso even than the other NFs. They hold up their end of the relationship, sometimes being victimized by less caring individuals. They are energized by being around people. Some have real difficulty being alone, especially on a regular basis."
ENFP,"One XXXX colleague, a social worker, had such tremendous interpersonal skills that she put her interviewers at ease during her own job interview. She had the ability to make strangers feel like old friends."
ENFP,"They sometimes can be blindsided by their secondary Feeling function. Hasty decisions based on deeply felt values may boil over with unpredictable results. More than one XXXX has abruptly quit a job in such a moment."
ENFP,"The physical world, both geos and kosmos, is the XXXX's primary source of information. Rather than sensing things as they are, dominant intuition is sensitive to things as they might be. These extraverted intuitives are most adept with patterns and connections. Their natural inclination is toward relationships, especially among people or living things."
ENFP,"Intuition leans heavily on feeling for meaning and focus. Its best patterns reflect the interesting points of people, giving rise to caricatures of manner, speech and expression."
ENFP,"Auxiliary feeling is nonverbally implied more often than it is openly expressed. When expressed, this logic has an aura of romance and purity that may seem out of place in this flawed, imperfect world. In its own defense, feeling judgement frequently and fleetly gives way to humor. They who publicize their feelings too often may put off some of the crowd of friends they naturally attract."
ENFP,"Thinking, the process which runs to impersonal conclusions, holds the extraverted tertiary position. Used on an occasional basis, They may benefit greatly from this ability. Less mature and lacking the polish of higher order functions, Thinking is not well suited to be used as a prominent function. As with other XXXX types, the XXXX unwary of Thinking's limitations may find themselves most positively mistaken."
ENFP,"Sensing, the least discernible XXXX function, resides in the inner world where reality is reduced to symbols and icons--ideas representing essences of external realities. Under the influence of the ever-present intuition, the XXXX's sensory perceptions are in danger of being replaced by hypothetical data consistent with pattern and paradigm. When it is protected and nourished, Xx provides information about the fixed. From such firm anchoring They are best equipped to launch into thousands of plausibilities and curiosities yet to be imagined."
ENFP,"Perhaps the combination of Xx and childlike Xx is responsible for the silent pull of They to the wishes of parents, authority figures and friends. Or perhaps it's the predominance of indecisive intuition in combination with the ambiguity of secondary Xx and tertiary Xx that induces these kind souls to capitulate even life-affecting decisions. Whatever the dynamic, They are strongly influenced by the opinions of their friends."
ENFP,"They are well-suited to occupations involving a lot of intellectual work focused on the humanities and social sciences, which also requires creativity. For example, they make good life coaches, social workers, psychologists, addiction rehab counsellors, and other mental and community care staff. They are also successful in teaching subjects related to the humanities and social sciences. Additionally, they succeed as journalists and in various occupations requiring good communication skills."
ENFP,"An XXXX’s interest in studying something is driven by the search for solutions to people-related issues, as well as the relevance and usefulness of what they learn to other people. The more positively they think that people will respond to the subject, the greater the XXXX’s interest and enjoyment in it, and the greater their desire to apply what they learn."
ENFP,"They easily grasp material, especially if a large portion of it is devoted to the topic’s relevance or connection to the behavior or actions of people. They are good at remembering theoretical material, especially when it actively engages their feelings. They can also easily grasp a significant amount of information lacking strong conceptual connections. Whether or not material is presented in a systematic and logical way is not of great importance to them. They strive to define their feelings toward the information that they are receiving."
ENFP,"They are able to learn independently. Even so, they are generally active communicators in the learning process, and group work is favorable. They like to discuss the topic of study and seek feedback on their work. They learn well through active learning methods like debates, contests, and educational games."
ENFP,"They are able to work with material they have learned well in a variety of ways. They are able to effectively apply it in different projects and develop it creatively beyond what they have been taught. They get excited and absorbed working with material they have learned and understood well, and really enjoy it."
ENFP,"They do not always evenly distribute their effort when learning and studying, and may put off work until the last minute."
ENFP,"The wish to understand others and to help them is what fills an XXXX’s life with meaning and serves as their main motivation. This is how they perceive the world and the people around them - their emotions and actions. One might say that orientation of an XXXX’s feelings is primarily defined by the following factors: opportunity to offer assistance vs. lack thereof, and acceptance vs. rejection. They feel their best when they have the opportunity to help and they are accepted by others and their worst when they encounter withdrawal and rejection."
ENFP,"Few can rival an XXXX in their ability to convince people and to earn their trust. They excel in feeling and understanding human relationships, and are always ready to pay attention to the other party’s feelings. An XXXX’s style of communication is characterized by their readiness to help by activating and developing other party’s abilities."
ENFP,"Communication with an XXXX is pleasant and easy. They often improvise in their discussion of various topics, although they can prepare a conversation agenda in advance. Many They are very energetic and always ready to join a discussion of any sort. They often initiate riveting discussions."
ENFP,"They dislike solitude and require company in everything they do. They try to diversify their interaction with others as much as possible so as to avoid monotony in communication."
ENFP,"They find it easy enough to communicate with people of different personality types on a variety of subjects, although their interest in topics that are heavily analytical in nature is somewhat lower."
ENFP,"An XXXX will have an extensive and diverse circle of friends and acquaintances. They do a great deal of active communicating at receptions and meetings, or during public events and recreational activities."
ENFP,"They tend to have a large number of business contacts, and their communication routine can be rather intense. Their co-workers (or others who work in the same field) are often reliant on, or interested in, their competent opinion of counsel on professional subjects. An XXXX’s communication agenda usually involves an exchange of ideas and opinions, professional consultation, and practical advice."
INFP,"They never seem to lose their sense of wonder. One might say they see life through rose-colored glasses. It's as though they live at the edge of a looking-glass world where mundane objects come to life, where flora and fauna take on near-human qualities."
INFP,"XXXX children often exhibit this in a 'Calvin and Hobbes' fashion, switching from reality to fantasy and back again. With few exceptions, it is the XXXX child who readily develops imaginary playmates (as with Anne of Green Gables's 'bookcase girlfriend'--her own reflection) and whose stuffed animals come to life like the Velveteen Rabbit and the Skin Horse: "
INFP,"They have the ability to see good in almost anyone or anything. Even for the most unlovable the XXXX is wont to have pity."
INFP,"Their extreme depth of feeling is often hidden, even from themselves, until circumstances evoke an impassioned response"
INFP,"Of course, not all of life is rosy, and They are not exempt from the same disappointments and frustrations common to humanity. As They tend to have a sense of failed competence, They struggle with the issue of their own ethical perfection, e.g., performance of duty for the greater cause. An XXXX friend describes the inner conflict as not good versus bad, but on a grand scale, Good vs. Evil. Luke Skywalker in Star Wars depicts this conflict in his struggle between the two sides of 'The Force.' Although the dark side must be reckoned with, the XXXX believes that good ultimately triumphs."
INFP,"Some They have a gift for taking technical information and putting it into layman's terms. Brendan Kehoe's Zen and the Art of the Internet is one example of this 'de-jargoning' talent in action."
INFP,"They live primarily in a rich inner world of Xx. Being inward-turning, the natural attraction is away from world and toward essence and ideal. This introversion of dominant Feeling, receiving its data from Xx, must be the source of the quixotic nature of these usually gentle beings. Feeling is caught in the approach- avoidance bind between concern both for people and for All Creatures Great and Small, and a psycho-magnetic repulsion from the same. The 'object,' be it homo sapiens or a mere representation of an organism, is valued only to the degree that the object contains some measure of the inner Essence or greater Good. Doing a good deed, for example, may provide intrinsic satisfaction which is only secondary to the greater good of striking a blow against Man's Inhumanity to Mankind."
INFP,"Xx faces outward, greeting the world on behalf of Feeling. What the observer usually sees is creativity with implied good will. Intuition spawns this type's philosophical bent and strengthens pattern perception. It combines as auxiliary with Xx and gives rise to unusual skill in both character development and fluency with language--a sound basis for the development of literary facility. If They aspire to word mechanics, They would be verbal artists."
INFP,"Sensing is introverted and often invisible. This stealth function in the third position gives They a natural inclination toward absent- mindedness and other-worldliness, however, Feeling's strong people awareness provides a balancing, mitigating effect. This Xx is somewhat categorical, a subdued version of XXXX sensing. In the third position, however, it is easily overridden by the stronger functions."
INFP,"The XXXX may turn to inferior Xx for help in focusing on externals and for closure. They can even masquerade in their XXXX business suit, but not without expending considerable energy. The inferior, problematic nature of Xx is its lack of context and proportion. Single impersonal facts may loom large or attain higher priority than more salient principles which are all but overlooked."
INFP,"Overall, They are effective in occupations involving a lot of intellectual work that is focused on the humanities and social sciences, the spirit and soul, inspirational activities, and those that require creativity. Social workers, psychologists, life coaches, addiction rehab counselors, mental and community care staff, elementary education, teaching, and creative script writing are just some of the examples of suitable occupations for They. They are also successful in academia thanks to their intellectual strength."
INFP,"An XXXX’s interest in learning a subject is related to the question, “Are we doing the right thing?” The more complete and in-depth the answer they receive during the learning process, the stronger their interest in the topic and the greater their desire to delve deeper into it. Their desire to study something is driven by their desire to find solutions to issues facing humanity."
INFP,"They easily grasp material, especially if a large part of it is devoted to how the topic relates to human behavior or activity. They are good at retaining theoretical material, especially when it actively engages their feelings. Needing to understand material that is purely logical or not related to the humanities or social sciences is boring to an XXXX. For example, they may find studying the rules of the road to be a tedious task."
INFP,"They understand new material with great depth and breadth. They are able to deeply grasp material independently. They are capable of mechanical memorization, but the amount retained this way is less than in memory based on understanding. They are able to accurately reproduce received information, especially if they associate it with any feelings."
INFP,"Group work on study material does not give They any advantage in comparison to individual work. Visual aids, though they do improve their capacity for learning, are not a very significant factor."
INFP,"They are able to actively work with material they have learned well and understood. They are capable of applying it in obvious, straightforward ways or creatively developing it beyond what they have been taught."
INFP,"They do not have a high level of tolerance to high levels of learning related stress."
INFP,"An XXXX's perception of the world is defined by such notions as just/unjust and right/wrong. They feel best when they do what they believe to be right and just."
INFP,"Few can rival an XXXX in their ability to deeply empathize with the other party's emotions and the struggle in their lives. They are capable of seeing deep into the other party's motives and sensing what the other party is concerned about the most. They are capable of inspiring people to develop their abilities and talents. They are capable of providing effective support to the other party so that the latter may better understand their spiritual side and the way they relate to others."
INFP,"They can be emotional in their communication with other people, although they always treat everyone with respect."
INFP,"They are able to speak with people of various personality types in their “language”, and on a variety of topics. However, at times They can come across as distant and reserved. Those are the periods when they reflect on their views of the world and people."
INFP,"They tend to have a wide circle of acquaintances — however, their inner circle of people they constantly communicate with is much more limited (it consists of close friends and like-minded individuals for the most part)."
INFP,"They tend to have a large number of business contacts, and their communication routine can be rather intense. Their colleagues (or others who work in the same field) are often reliant on, or interested in, their expert opinion of counsel on professional subjects. An XXXX is capable of maintaining an eventful business communication agenda involving an exchange of ideas, opinions, and advice. Some They are capable of having ideas of such great depth and importance that they become shared by a large number of people. In such cases, the number of those who wish to communicate with such a person grows enormously, so this XXXX will have to communicate through a media, being unable to establish personal contact with everyone."
INFJ,"They are creative nurturers with a strong sense of personal integrity and a drive to help others realize their potential. Creative and dedicated, they have a talent for helping others with original solutions to their personal challenges."
INFJ,"The Counselor has a unique ability to intuit others' emotions and motivations, and will often know how someone else is feeling before that person knows it himself. They trust their insights about others and have strong faith in their ability to read people. Although they are sensitive, they are also reserved; the XXXX is a private sort, and is selective about sharing intimate thoughts and feelings."
INFJ,"They are guided by a deeply considered set of personal values. They are intensely idealistic, and can clearly imagine a happier and more perfect future. They can become discouraged by the harsh realities of the present, but they are typically motivated and persistent in taking positive action nonetheless. The XXXX feels an intrinsic drive to do what they can to make the world a better place."
INFJ,"They want a meaningful life and deep connections with other people. They do not tend to share themselves freely but appreciate emotional intimacy with a select, committed few. Although their rich inner life can sometimes make them seem mysterious or private to others, they profoundly value authentic connections with people they trust."
INFJ,"They often appear quiet, caring and sensitive, and may be found listening attentively to someone else’s ideas or concerns. They are highly perceptive about people and want to help others achieve understanding. They are not afraid of complex personal problems; in fact, they are quite complex themselves, and have a rich inner life that few are privy to. They reflect at length on issues of ethics, and feel things deeply. Because Counselors initially appear so gentle and reserved, they may surprise others with their intensity when one of their values is threatened or called into question. Their calm exterior belies the complexity of their inner worlds."
INFJ,"Because They are such complex people, they may be reluctant to engage with others who might not understand or appreciate them, and can thus be hard to get to know. Although they want to get along with others and support them in their goals, they are fiercely loyal to their own system of values and will not follow others down a path that does not feel authentic to them. When they sense that their values are not being respected, or when their intuition tells them that someone’s intentions are not pure, they are likely to withdraw.. Least common type in the population. On personality trait scales, scored as Sincere, Sympathetic, Unassuming, Submissive, Easygoing, Reserved and Patient. Among highest of all types in college GPA. Among most likely to stay in college. Most likely of all types to cope with stress by seeing a therapist. Highest of all types in marital dissatisfaction. Personal values include Spirituality, Learning, and Community Service. Commonly found in careers in religion, counseling, teaching, and the arts"
INFJ,"Popular hobbies for the XXXX include writing, art appreciation, cultural events, reading, socializing in small, intimate settings, and playing or listening to music."
INFJ,"Practical insight. Some people are visionaries while others are down-to-earth problem solvers, but They manage to straddle the line between both identities—and they usually succeed masterfully. They are insightful thinkers who see through situations and people effectively and enjoy developing practical strategies for action."
INFJ,"Compassion. As a Feeling type, you might expect an XXXX to show compassion—but what sets them apart is that their empathy comes with a sharp intuitive edge. They are quick to recognize worry and unhappiness in friends and loved ones, even when outward signs of distress are not visible to others. They are uniquely capable of detecting unspoken and unacknowledged suffering, and are called into action by their instinctive ability to see beneath the surface."
INFJ,"Keeping the peace. Mediating disputes is hard work, but They have an astounding ability to help heal the rifts that divide people. They intuitively sense the real suffering that anger can cause if left to fester, and because they are good listeners they are quite effective at helping warring parties find workable solutions that will satisfy the needs of all. And they do it with great energy and determination."
INFJ,"Decisiveness. For They, obstacles exist to be overcome and no problem can outmatch the strength and resilience that these types possess deep inside. They follow through on their ideas with conviction, and have the willpower and decisiveness necessary to see projects through to the end. They live for the opportunity to solve problems and bring about positive change in the world."
INFJ,"Overlooking details. No matter how practically-oriented they aspire to be, They have a tendency to get so caught up in theorizing the big picture that they forget to account for some of the precious details that can separate success from failure. Details always matter, and while They may recognize this in principle, in practice they aren’t always as diligent about the small stuff as they should be."
INFJ,"Intensely private. Despite their loving and sensitive natures, They have a tendency to close themselves off from the world and don’t give people the chance to know them or see the wonderful qualities they possess. Even in their relations with family and trusted friends, They can be enigmatic. When they are feeling frustrated or introspective, they may retreat from social contact without so much as a word of explanation, which can throw others for a loop."
INFJ,"Conflict averse. They dislike conflict intensely and will usually intervene to stop it, but this is one area where their perspective can get distorted. They often fail to recognize that conflict can actually serve a useful purpose, allowing a good process of give-and-take to be established and giving all parties the opportunity to resolve their problem forever. They would be wise to acknowledge the value of open and honest dialogue, instead of automatically assuming that all squabbling is harmful."
INFJ,"Sensitive. Once an XXXX has made up their mind, they tend to be very confident in their conclusions and may not have much tolerance for those who continue to dissent. When someone challenges their conclusions, they can react very strongly and are especially vulnerable to criticism."
INFJ,"Question their intuition. They have outstanding instincts for the most part, but sometimes their intuition betrays them when they are dealing with others. When something is bothering them, They will often withdraw into the safety of their own heads rather than speaking openly about what they are feeling; conversely, they seldom express their feelings of love, affection and appreciation as directly as might be expected given the depth of the emotions they experience. To improve their communication habits, They should go out of their way to share their feelings—both good and bad—with others regardless of how uncomfortable it makes them feel to do so."
INFJ,"Give others the benefit of the doubt. They are insightful, instinctive and persuasive. But despite the enormous effort that They invest in developing and selling their concepts and ideas, sometimes dissidents will remain. They sometimes become disenchanted with those who refuse to accept their conclusions, and they will convince themselves that their opponents have hidden agendas and are acting in bad faith. When situations like this arise, They should try to accept that total consensus is impossible and that some will continue to hold contrary viewpoints. In situations like this, both sides should simply agree to disagree and move on."
INFJ,"Let others agree to disagree, too. When tensions are high and arguments are heated, They will do all they can to restore lost cohesion and tranquility. But their love of harmony and aversion to division is so powerful that They refuse to accept that sometimes the best way to end disputes is to bring them out into the open, where bridges of understanding can be built. On balance, They’ dislike of conflict is a good thing. But their efforts to play peacemaker might be more successful if they would concentrate on keeping the lines of communication open when disagreements arise instead of always trying to sweep everything under the rug."
INFJ,"Make connections with extraverts. Because sharing with anyone outside a small trusted circle goes against their instincts, too often talented They choose to keep their gifts wrapped up and hidden even though they have much to contribute. But They would benefit by cultivating friendly relationships with extraverted people whenever possible. Opposites attract, and there is no doubt that being around more naturally open and communicative people can help bring They out of their shells and out into the world where others can benefit from their intellect, empathy and compassion."
INFJ,"Slow down! They are productive and effective when they make a concerted effort to focus on one project at a time. But their fertile imaginations frequently undermine their efforts to stay on the straight and narrow, and they will often start new projects based on fresh inspirations before old ones are finished—and, before they know it, they will find themselves buried under an avalanche of work. There is really nothing They can do to moderate the pace of their inspirations, but if they constantly remind themselves to slow down and take things one at a time, they may be able to resist the urge to go off on tangents at least some of the time."
INFJ,"At work, the XXXX is focused on the task of bettering the human condition. They are dedicated, helpful, and principled workers who can be relied on to envision, plan, and carry out complex projects for humanitarian causes."
INFJ,"Although they are typically driven by lofty ideals, Counselors gain the most satisfaction from their work when they can turn their ideas into reality, creating constructive change for other people."
INFJ,"They are typically organized and prefer work that allows them to complete projects in an orderly manner. They are often independent and tend to prefer a quiet environment that allows them the opportunity to fully develop their own thoughts and ideas."
INFJ,"The ideal work environment for an XXXX is harmonious, industrious, and oriented to a humanitarian mission, with co-workers who are similarly committed to positive change. The ideal job for a Counselor allows them to use their creativity in an independent, organized environment to develop and implement a vision that is consistent with their personal values."
INFJ,"The top driver for They in choosing a career is the opportunity to do something that is consistent with their values. Often, They choose careers in helping professions like health care, education, or counseling. They are thinkers by nature and appreciate careers that allow them to use their intellect on problems that interest them. Often, these are people problems, for instance in psychology, but They can also be found in other areas of the sciences and even engineering."
INFJ,"Many They have a creative streak which can be seen in the top XXXX career trends. Working with language is especially popular for They, but they can also be found in various fields in the arts."
INFJ,"Health care careers are a wonderful opportunity for They to combine their deep caring for the welfare of other people with their often formidable intellectual capabilities. Many They enjoy the sciences and find it extremely satisfying to put their scientific knowledge to use in helping others."
INFJ,"They are typically wonderful listeners and deep, insightful thinkers when it comes to personal problems. They have a high degree of intuition about people and a deep well of patience in dealing with sticky emotional situations. All of these qualities make them talented, compassionate counselors, social servicepeople, and religious workers."
INFJ,"They often enjoy the intellectual challenge of the sciences, and can be found in scientific careers that relate to their values."
INFJ,"They are often found making the business world a little more human, in HR, training, or the more humanitarian professions within the law."
INFJ,"Although teaching in front of a classroom is a typically Extraverted activity and can be a challenge for more Introverted They, they often find it deeply satisfying to help children and adults grow and develop. Education careers that involve working with smaller groups, or one-on-one, are an especially good fit."
INFJ,"Many They love the expressive quality of language, and they typically have the focus and concentration necessary to be excellent writers and editors."
INFJ,"They are creative solvers of people problems, and bring innovative ideas for fostering human potential. They are usually perceptive in observing the talents of others, and good at encouraging teammates to contribute their skills. They are mindful of group process, listening attentively to the opinions of others and synthesizing varied priorities to create a unified vision. Because they prefer to accommodate all points of view, Counselors may have trouble on very competitive or conflictual teams."
INFJ,"On a team, the XXXX acts as a source of quiet inspiration and vision, and provides clarity of purpose to the group. They seek meaning and truth, and will reflect on ideas to create a deeper understanding. Although they don’t often call attention to themselves, they can provide insight into the ethical and humanitarian issues at hand, and can often elegantly articulate the group’s mission. Counselors work best on a supportive team where they can consider issues of ethics and values and act with integrity. Teams which move to act quickly without taking time to reflect may alienate the INFJ,"
INFJ,"In leadership positions, They motivate others by sharing a positive vision. Counselor leaders are often quiet and unassuming, but win other's dedication through their own hard work, strong principles, and inspiring ideas. They are at their best when guiding a team to commit to a common vision, and when creating organizational goals to benefit people. They are insightful and creative, and bring a sense of confidence and commitment to projects they believe in."
INFJ,"Because XXXX leaders are often motivated by personal values, they do best in organizations with a mission consistent with these values. Their challenge is to keep their ideas and initiatives realistic, and to consider practicalities as they plan for change."
INFJ,"In relationships, the XXXX is supportive and guided by a sense of integrity. The XXXX's interest in human development applies to their mates as well, and they are encouraging of their partner's dreams, aspirations, and achievements."
INFJ,"They want to maintain harmony in their relationships and are highly motivated to resolve conflicts. They tend to be creative problem-solvers and look for the emotional core of an issue to create a meeting of the minds. Although they desire cooperation, they are not willing to go along with an idea that does not feel authentic to them. When it comes to their core values and ethics, they are unwilling to compromise."
INFJ,"They want a high degree of intimacy and emotional engagement, and are happiest when they feel they are sharing their innermost thoughts and feelings with their mates. They value a partner who respects their deeply held values and ethics, and one who appreciates their creativity and inspiration."
INFJ,"As parents, They are devoted and loving. They tend to form strong bonds with their children and are very closely tuned in to their emotional states. Counselor parents naturally see the possibilities in their children and encourage them to develop their potential."
INFJ,"Although they support their children in their individual interests, XXXX parents are firm disciplinarians, particularly when it comes to moral or ethical concerns. They are concerned with their children's emotional health and spiritual development, and want to create a nurturing atmosphere that promotes growth and well-being."
INFJ,"They are reserved about communication, and often keep their most treasured ideas and insights private. They are oriented to values and connection, and will search for meaning in the information they take in. They think deeply and often need time to process and evaluate before they are ready to share their ideas. They seek validation and will take the time to appreciate others and their ideas. They are often talented at making connections to bring people together and integrate ideas, values, and human potential."
INFP,"They are imaginative idealists, guided by their own core values and beliefs. To a Healer, possibilities are paramount; the realism of the moment is only of passing concern. They see potential for a better future, and pursue truth and meaning with their own individual flair."
INFP,"They are sensitive, caring, and compassionate, and are deeply concerned with the personal growth of themselves and others. Individualistic and nonjudgmental, They believe that each person must find their own path. They enjoy spending time exploring their own ideas and values, and are gently encouraging to others to do the same. They are creative and often artistic; they enjoy finding new outlets for self-expression."
INFP,"They value authenticity and want to be original and individual in what they do. They are often concerned with a search for meaning and truth within themselves. Following tradition holds little appeal for the XXXX; they prefer to do their own exploration of values and ideas, and decide for themselves what seems right. They are often offbeat and unconventional, but they feel no desire to conform. The XXXX would rather be true to themselves than try to fit in with the crowd."
INFP,"They are accepting and nonjudgmental in their treatment of others, believing that each person must follow their own path. They are flexible and accommodating, and can often see many points of view. It is important to the XXXX to support other people; however, the XXXX may react strongly if they feel their own values are being violated. They especially hate being steamrolled by people who insist there is one right way to do things. They want an open, supportive exchange of ideas."
INFP,"They may initially seem cool, as they reserve their most authentic thoughts and feelings for people they know well. They are reflective and often spiritual, and often interested in having meaningful conversations about values, ethics, people, and personal growth. Typically curious and open-minded, the Healer continually seeks a deeper understanding of themselves and of the people around them. They are passionate about their ideals, but private as well; few people understand the depth of the XXXX’s commitment to their beliefs."
INFP,"They are sensitive and empathetic, and engage themselves in a lifelong quest for meaning and authenticity. The mundane aspects of life are of less interest to this type, and they are more excited by interesting ideas than by practical facts. They typically accept others without question, and may take special interest in offbeat points of view or alternative lifestyles. They often have a special affection for the arts, especially the avant garde, as they love experiencing new concepts in self-expression.. On personality trait measures, score as Artistic, Reflective, Careless, Sensitive, Flexible, and Appreciative. Among least likely of all types to suffer heart disease. In men, among least likely to report chronic pain. Second highest of all types to report marital dissatisfaction. Among most likely to have suicidal thoughts in college. Tend to be more successful than the average in learning a foreign language. Among types most likely to be dissatisfied with their work. Personal values include Autonomy and Creativity. Overrepresented in occupations in counseling, writing, and the arts"
INFP,"Popular hobbies for They include poetry, creative writing, music, photography, theater, and visual art."
INFP,"Idealism. They care deeply for others and believe it is their duty to make a positive impact on the lives of other people in any way they can. Because of this unbreakable commitment, They are capable of great self-sacrifice, and they won’t compromise their ethical standards for personal benefit. They are firm believers in the unlimited potential of human beings to achieve remarkable things, and they can always be counted on to provide encouragement or material support to those who are attempting to expand their horizons."
INFP,"Integrity. Integrity means everything to They, and that includes intellectual as well as moral integrity. Some people might accuse They of being overly imaginative or of being willing to stretch logic to the breaking point in order to find the deeper meaning they insist must exist, but there is no denying that the deeply reflective nature of They allows them to transcend the boundaries of imagination that so often prevent us from discovering new solutions to old problems."
INFP,"Compromise. As empathic idealists, harmonious relations are like a balm to the soul for They. In family settings or when working in groups, They are highly effective as mediators because they are legitimately interested in the viewpoints of all and will go out of their way to make sure that everyone is given a fair hearing. They are enthusiastic advocates of cooperation and believe that no difficulty is insurmountable when people work together for a common cause."
INFP,"Dedication. It is easy to pay lip service to virtues like compassion, creativity, originality and open- mindedness, but these ideas don’t mean much unless they can be translated into real-world applications. Fortunately, They are masters at doing just that. Passionate and committed to the cause, these personalities have a unique ability to mold and shape their surrounding environment in ways that promote self- improvement and transcendent achievement for all."
INFP,"Sensitivity. Their deep compassion, sensitivity and commitment to originality allows They to interface with their interpersonal landscapes in a constructive manner, but these feelings also leave them vulnerable to disillusionment and powerful existential angst. They who venture enthusiastically out into the world can end up retreating into lethargy and depression when they discover their idealism isn’t always shared or respected by others, and their incredible talents can go completely to waste when they become too discouraged to continue."
INFP,"Impracticality. While their insistence on standing up for justice and decency is admirable, the intensity of their feelings can occasionally leave They unwilling to make compromises even when doing so might be necessary to get something accomplished. Sticking to your morals is admirable, but in the real world it may be impossible to accomplish anything unless the XXXX can find a way to give and take a little and find practical, if imperfect, solutions to problems."
INFP,"Selflessness. They have a tendency to neglect or suppress their own needs if they believe it is necessary to keep the peace or make others happy. When a person holds his or her insecurities inside for too long, it can eventually cause a blow-up or an emotional breakdown. Sensitive They often suffer in silence, and this is a pity because They and their fellow travelers usually have people in their lives who care about them a lot and would be more than happy to help them deal with their heartaches and disappointments."
INFP,"Vulnerability. Compassionate to the core, They lead with their hearts rather than their heads and this can sometimes set them up for trouble. Unfortunately there are users and manipulators out there who are always on the lookout for easy targets, and from the standpoint of these individuals XXXXS might as well have flashing neon signs attached to their foreheads that say “exploit me, exploit me!” Trust is a wonderful thing, but not when it makes you gullible."
INFP,"Learn to recognize the difference between compromise and concession. People who disagree with They are simply seeing things from a different point of view, but to an XXXX, it can feel like they are being backed into a corner. Instead of digging in their heels, They must find a way to detach from the situation so they can comprehend the motivations of their opposition more clearly. If it is only a difference in values and not a lack of them that is responsible for divergent opinions, then They should not expect others to give in to stubbornness any more than they would if the shoe were on the other foot."
INFP,"Make sure dreams and fantasies are used to enhance reality rather than replace it. They who look out at the world with idealistic eyes often see grand vistas of beauty and limitless possibility that others are not capable of perceiving. But They sometimes choose to retreat into these fantasies instead of using them to solve real-world problems. Imagination can open the door to better possibilities, and They should never lose sight of its transformative potential."
INFP,"Learn to respect the details. No matter how wonderfully inventive a new idea might be, it won’t get anywhere if the logistical details required to put it into practice are ignored or neglected. They may find this aspect of the creative processes a bit boring, but they should challenge themselves to overcome their disinterest and pay attention to all those annoying details anyway."
INFP,"Seek out leadership positions. They have strong egalitarian instincts, are natural conciliators, passionately believe in the utility of cooperation, are excellent listeners, and never fail to pay attention when someone has a new idea to share. These admirable qualities double as superb leadership skills, and no one who possesses them should avoid leadership positions simply because they aren’t extraverts. Above all else, leaders must have the respect of those they presume to lead, and They are just as capable of gaining that respect as any other personality type."
INFP,"Accept themselves as they are without apology. Because their standards are so high, They have a hard time forgiving themselves when they fail to meet their own expectations. They may also become indecisive and fall into a perfectionism so extreme that it cuts off their flow of creativity and makes it impossible for them to excel and achieve. This dynamic is unfortunate, especially as They would never think of holding others to such impossible standards. For the sake of their mental health and happiness, They must learn to stop comparing themselves to others and recognize that they should prioritize their own happiness."
INFP,"At work, the XXXX is not particularly driven by money or status, preferring work that aligns with their personal values and allows them to help others. They are typically motivated by vision and inspiration, and want to engage with projects and causes that feel important to them."
INFP,"They enjoy the process of creative problem-solving, and want to understand complex issues. They appreciate innovation, and want to come up with original ideas to improve circumstances for people. An ideal job for a Healer allows them to express their individuality in the way they work, and takes advantage of their ability to see unique solutions."
INFP,"They enjoy working autonomously and having control over how and when to complete a project. They often enjoy participating in teams, although they want to be free to put their own personal stamp on their work. When they do work with other people, it's important to the XXXX that they be cooperative, supportive, and flexible, and that they have similar passion for their ideals."
INFP,"They are supportive and imaginative team members who contribute by understanding the ideals of their teammates and working to bring unity to the group’s mission. They listen openly to many points of view, and are talented at coming up with creative solutions that incorporate the ideas and priorities of everyone involved. They are flexible and innovate thinkers, and are willing to consider almost any option, so long as it is congruent with their values."
INFP,"They do best on a team that is guided by vision, and want to have an authentic understanding of the team’s purpose. They want to have team members who are similarly committed to a cause, and who are willing to explore the possibilities for achieving their ideals. Teams which are highly oriented to action, without considering the deeper issues or the alternative options, may alienate the XXXX. They want an environment of mutual support and acceptance, and may have trouble on teams where there is much conflict or competition. Judgment and negativity tend to stifle their talent for creative problem-solving."
INFP,"In leadership positions, They motivate others through encouragement and positive vision. They are deeply idealistic, and when working for a cause that is important to them, they bring a quiet determination to their leadership role. They often see the potential in other people, and are good at inspiring others to use their gifts."
INFP,"They are supportive, creative leaders who encourage their teams to think outside the box. Because of their flexible nature and strong desire for harmony, they may avoid conflict and delay making difficult decisions. They do best leading cooperative teams of like-minded people who are similarly committed to their vision."
INFP,"In relationships, the XXXX is nurturing, empathic, and loyal. Healers select their friends and partners carefully, looking for a strong bond and congruent values. They are self-aware and often spiritual."
INFP,"They tend to be open-minded and accepting of another's behavior and preferences, so long as their core values are not violated. They support their partners' individuality, and encourage them to explore their interests and ideas."
INFP,"They look for ways to compromise and accommodate other people, and often have creative solutions to interpersonal problems. They can be very sensitive, but often keep negative reactions to themselves because they are reluctant to engage in confrontation."
INFP,"Close and harmonious relationships are important to They, although they also need a lot of independent time to think and reflect. They often want plenty of freedom to express themselves and pursue greater self-awareness. They value a partner who is committed and loving, yet provides them with the support they need to independently explore the mysteries of life."
INFP,"As parents, They are caring, supportive, and adaptable. They rarely establish a strict or structured household, preferring instead to address problems and situations as they arise. They often allow their children a lot of latitude and influence in making decisions, and may leave the creation and enforcement of household rules up to another parent."
INFP,"Children of They often find that they have the freedom to express themselves and make their own decisions until they violate their XXXX parent's values. When values are in question, the Healer parent becomes firm and inflexible."
INFP,"They are gentle, encouraging communicators who enjoy exploring options and ideas. They envision possibilities for people and are often good at coming up with creative, flexible solutions to problems. They are typically attentive listeners who try to adapt their communication style to the people they are dealing with. Compassionate and cooperative, they tend to be appreciative of other people and their ideas, although they may be reserved about sharing their own closely held values and ideas with people they do not know well."
ENFJ,"They are idealist organizers, driven to implement their vision of what is best for humanity. They often act as catalysts for human growth because of their ability to see potential in other people and their charisma in persuading others to their ideas. They are focused on values and vision, and are passionate about the possibilities for people."
ENFJ,"They are typically energetic and driven, and often have a lot on their plates. They are tuned into the needs of others and acutely aware of human suffering; however, they also tend to be optimistic and forward-thinking, intuitively seeing opportunity for improvement. The XXXX is ambitious, but their ambition is not self-serving: rather, they feel personally responsible for making the world a better place."
ENFJ,"They are driven by a deep sense of altruism and empathy for other people. They have an intuitive sense of the emotions of others, and often act as an emotional barometer for the people around them. However, their compassion not reserved for the people close to them: they are often humanitarian in nature, and may feel genuine concern for the ills of the entire human race. They tend to personally experience the feelings of others, and feel compelled to act when they see people suffering."
ENFJ,"They want close, supportive connections with others, and believe that cooperation is the best way to get things done. They like to be liked and are very sensitive to feedback, both positive and negative. They expect the best not just from themselves, but from others as well, and may find themselves disappointed when others are not as genuine in their intentions as the XXXX. They work hard to maintain strong relationships, and strive to be valuable members of their families, groups, and communities."
ENFJ,"They are natural teachers, often found organizing people to take part in some educational activity. They tend to take charge of a situation, and guide a group towards those activities and experiences which will help them learn and grow. They intuitively see the potential in people, and with charisma and warmth, they encourage others to pursue greater development of their strengths. They are typically dynamic and productive, and are often visibly energized when leading others to discover new knowledge."
ENFJ,"They are typically good communicators, talented at using words to connect with others. They are perceptive about people and enjoy talking about relationships. They often enjoy helping others solve personal problems and like to share their insights about people, their emotions, and their motivations. They are empathetic sometimes to the point of being overinvolved, and can become exhausted if they are surrounded by too much negative emotion.. On personality trait scales, scored as Active, Pleasant, Sociable, Demanding, Impatient, Appreciative, and Compromising. Most likely of all types to cope with stress by exercising. Most likely of all types to believe in a higher spiritual power. Ranked by psychologists as among least likely to have trouble in school. Personal values include Friendships, Education & Learning, Creativity, and Community Service. Among types highest in job satisfaction, but also among most likely to report plans to leave their jobs. Commonly found in careers in religion, teaching, and the arts"
ENFJ,"Popular hobbies for the XXXX include organizing social events, reading, the arts, museums, storytelling, listening to music, writing, and gourmet cooking."
ENFJ,"Peacekeeping. They not only work to promote harmony and morale while deflecting potential conflicts, they are also deft in persuading and motivating others to get moving in the same direction. They see positive relationships as the sure path to fulfillment and are highly cooperative, promoting cohesion and even friendship within the workplace and beyond."
ENFJ,"Communication. One of the many keys to an XXXX’s success is the ability to communicate proficiently across diverse media. They have a talent for making words out of ideas whether it is in the classroom or in a love letter. They love writing, talking and telling stories, and their audiences are often equally as enthusiastic to receive what they have to say. As comfortable in large crowds as small groups, they like to be the center of attention and thrive on the energy of good conversation, especially with people who are as passionate as they are."
ENFJ,"Persuasiveness. They are known for their powers of persuasion and are generally effective in getting people to do what they want them to do. But They are charitable; the motive is not often manipulation or personal gain, they simply want people to do more or better because it will benefit them or help them realize some potential. These personalities are likeable and trustworthy and, as a result, others are generally compelled to listen to and follow them."
ENFJ,"Leadership. They have a solid social circle and are likely to be the ones planning events and finding opportunities to get people together. Their leadership skills ensure that others quickly jump on board and are excited about it. Teaching and mentoring come as easily to them as breathing and talking, making They particularly skilled in endeavors that allow them to lead, train or educate. Their idealism helps them to very clearly and accurately see the potential in other people and entities, and their Judging element helps them to map out the path to get there."
ENFJ,"Leap before looking. Passionate and headstrong, They tend to dive in head first without fully examining or investigating the endeavor in front of them, or fully considering what it will entail. Their Intuitive nature gets the best of them and they are quite sure they have it all figured out; they may not concern themselves with the necessary and important details."
ENFJ,"Overcommitment. Though they thrive on being a little overwhelmed, They can easily become over-committed because they are genuinely excited about life and all of the opportunities they see before them—they want to say “yes” as much as they can and they want to do it all. As a result, they may later have to pull out of commitments they might have examined more carefully before jumping in, and often end up starting and stopping many things without finishing."
ENFJ,"Struggle to make tough decisions. When making decisions, They can struggle with information that seems to lack a human element. Hard logic, impersonal reasoning and data-based conclusions can be difficult and even undesirable. While They may be viewed as compassionate, they may also be seen as unfair since they are likely to prioritize the needs of the individual above the whole, and to look more readily to the exceptions than the rules."
ENFJ,"Too selfless. Because They prioritize people and the needs of others, they may not be properly in touch with their own needs and can struggle, at times, to express them if they fear that doing so may create conflict or disunity. If they have not developed a strong sense of self they may fail to be authentic in their relationships. As They already tend toward loneliness, the sense that no one truly knows them can foment the sense of being alone and misunderstood."
ENFJ,"Focus on the details. Though the XXXX reads best between the lines, there are times when the nit-picky details really do matter and, in the end, the boring, impersonal contracts just need to be read. This will be a forced response, but a necessary one. In committing to various projects, endeavors or events, the XXXX will benefit from a simple “let me think about it” and then actually taking the time to consider the details, objectives and time commitment before responding."
ENFJ,"Stick to it. They love starting projects and new endeavors, but sometimes bite off more than they can chew. Rather than looking at the project as a whole and becoming overwhelmed, breaking the work into small pieces and viewing each chunk as a distinct goal can help the XXXX maintain enthusiasm and drive."
ENFJ,"Get comfortable with conflict. Disunity, divisiveness and conflict are not the end of the world and not something always to be avoided. They do crave amicable rather than adversarial relationships, but growth often happens in the space of tension. When the XXXX allows himself to intentionally confront and deal with conflict, good things—even deepened relationships—may result."
ENFJ,"Live in the now. They are, by nature, future-oriented and while this helps them to visualize potential, it can keep them from dealing with life in the here and now—the possibilities are so much more exciting than the present reality! While They will continue to look to the best the future has to offer, they need to put their scheduling and planning skills into practice to get going on the tasks of today so that they may achieve their future goals."
ENFJ,"Mind their bottom line. While They do derive personal satisfaction from being helpful to others, they must be serious about their own talents and the income that should come as a result. It is possible to help people, make a contribution to the world and make a living wage. The XXXX may also need to work on becoming more task oriented and concerned with productivity. It is easy to get caught up in the relational aspects of a project or job and fail to meet the objectives and expectations. The XXXX will have to work to keep interpersonal relations and productivity in balance."
ENFJ,"At work, the XXXX is motivated to organize others to implement positive change. They are enthusiastic problem-solvers, especially when they can put their strong intuition about people to good use."
ENFJ,"They strive for cooperation and work best in a harmonious environment where they can support other people and encourage their growth. They often take on a mentor role, seeing their primary aim as helping other people become better at what they do."
ENFJ,"They are often attracted to leadership roles; they naturally organize people to take advantage of their unique talents. They often have a strong vision in their work, and enjoy being able to use their creativity to develop innovative initiatives with a humanitarian focus. They appreciate teamwork, and they want to have the organizational resources to put their ideas into action."
ENFJ,"The ideal work environment for an XXXX is forward-thinking and people-centered, with a clear humanitarian mission and an emphasis on constructive action. The ideal job for an XXXX allows them to develop and implement ideas that improve the circumstances and well-being of other people."
ENFJ,"They are collaborative, inspirational team members who are interested in working together to implement plans for progress. XXXX team members work from supportive relationships as their foundation; they are skilled at understanding the needs and priorities of others and talented at building consensus. They have a natural enthusiasm, and tend to engage their team members in their vision."
ENFJ,"Because they are so oriented to cooperation, They can be ineffective on teams in conflict; they may become so engaged with trying to create harmony that they neglect to make an objective evaluation. Although they usually have a strong sense of purpose, they are more people-focused than task-focused, and will prioritize the growth and development of others throughout the process. They sometimes need to refocus on the task at hand, as they can spend so much time mentoring and encouraging others that they forget the team’s primary goal."
ENFJ,"In leadership posiitons, They are enthusiastic, supportive, and action-oriented. They are strong leaders with clear ideas about how to improve organizations to better serve the needs of people. They are confident in their mission, but often balance their goal orientation with a focus on interpersonal process. They seek cooperation, and want others on board, in action and in spirit. They often take on a mentorship role; they like to help their employees develop as workers and as people."
ENFJ,"Although They typically enjoy leadership, they can become discouraged in environments with ongoing conflict. They have a deep need to be appreciated and can become drained and ineffective in positions where they are not able to elicit support for their ideas and values."
ENFJ,"In relationships, the XXXX is helpful and enthusiastically supportive. They are motivated to understand their partners and to do what pleases them, and are sensitive the the emotions and reactions of their mates."
ENFJ,"They make great cheerleaders, and will encourage their partners to develop and explore their potential. They are engaged and ready to help, and look for opportunities to support their mates in their accomplishments."
ENFJ,"XXXX partners want harmony above all else, sometimes at the expense of their own needs. Conflict is upsetting to They, and they often avoid it. They are very sensitive to criticism and can become highly emotional and even punishing when their feelings are hurt. However, they have great insight about people, emotions and motivations; they are often able to put this talent to use in resolving things."
ENFJ,"The ideal mate for an XXXX appreciates their compassion, support, and dedication to helping others, and makes an effort to understand the XXXX's feelings and values."
ENFJ,"As parents, They take an active and enthusiastic role in guiding the development of their children. They enjoy teaching their children the ways of the world, and set forth clear ideas of right and wrong in a warm and supportive way."
ENFJ,"They have high expectations for their children, and often envision bright futures for them. They have an interest in their children's potential and want to inspire them to develop it. They can sometimes idealize their children, becoming disappointed when they don't live up to expectations. They may take their children's misbehavior personally, feeling that they have failed to instill their own strong values."
ENFJ,"They are warm, compassionate communicators who show enthusiasm for other people and their ideas. They want to understand what is important to others so that they can take action to improve the situation for all involved. They readily give affirmation and support, making sure that people know that their ideas are valued. They are good at connecting with a variety of people and creative in coming up with solutions that accommodate others’ needs. They are often natural teachers and mentors, showing others the way and helping them to improve themselves."
ENFP,"They are people-centered creators with a focus on possibilities and a contagious enthusiasm for new ideas, people and activities. Energetic, warm, and passionate, They love to help other people explore their creative potential."
ENFP,"They are typically agile and expressive communicators, using their wit, humor, and mastery of language to create engaging stories. Imaginative and original, They often have a strong artistic side. They are drawn to art because of its ability to express inventive ideas and create a deeper understanding of human experience."
ENFP,"They tend to be curious about others and preoccupied with discovering the deeper meaning in people and ideas. They want authentic experience and often seek emotional intensity. They are easily bored by details and repetition and seek out situations that offer an escape from the mundane. Novelty is attractive to They, who often have a wide range of interests and friends from many backgrounds."
ENFP,"They prize individuality and often consider the pursuit of happiness to be the highest priority in life, both for themselves and for others. They place great importance on personal freedom and self-expression, and want to be able to go wherever inspiration leads."
ENFP,"They love to talk about people: not just the facts, but what motivates them, what inspires them, and what they envision achieving in life. They’ll often share their own aspirations freely, and want to hear others’ in return. The XXXX is unlikely to judge anyone’s dream, and will discuss the most imaginative and outlandish of fantasies with warm, enthusiastic intensity. They love to explore creative possibilities, and nothing deflates them faster than talking about dry facts or harsh reality."
ENFP,"They often seem unconventional, and may come off as scattered; they don’t tend to be in touch with their physical surroundings. They often overlook the details, as they are more likely to focus on connecting with other people or on exploring their own imagination and self-expression. They have little patience for the mundane and want to experience life with intensity and flair. They often have an artistic streak, and may be artistic in appearance. Many have developed a distinctive and quirky personal style.. On personality trait scales, scored as Enthusiastic, Outgoing, Spontaneous, Changeable, Impulsive, Energetic, and Understanding. Scored among highest of all types in available resources for coping with stress. XXXX women are less likely to suffer from heart disease. XXXX men are less likely to suffer from chronic pain. Rated by psychologists as among most likely of all types to have trouble in school. Overrepresented among academically talented elementary school students. Personal values include Home & family, Friendships, Creativity, Learning, and Community Service. Commonly found in careers in counseling, teaching, religion, and the arts"
ENFP,"Excellent communicators. They have outstanding communication skills and they know how to use them. They will engage anyone in conversation at the drop of a hat, and they know how to draw others out in a way that keeps the discussion flowing. Whether casually shooting the breeze or collaborating in the workplace, They provide the horsepower that keeps the engine of conversation humming along."
ENFP,"Imaginative. They are imaginative problem solvers and reject the idea that traditional ways are always the best. In every situation they believe an original approach is possible—and desirable—and they refuse to become prisoners of habit or routine. They see roadblocks as opportunities, and they confront every challenge they face with fresh eyes and no preconceived notions."
ENFP,"Natural leaders. They step forward to assume positions of leadership readily and instinctively. They are confident in their ability to handle demanding responsibilities many people find scary or intimidating. XXXX leaders are consensus builders who work hard to gain the trust of their associates, patiently listening to their ideas and reacting enthusiastically to their good suggestions. Their assertive, “can-do” attitude inspires others and motivates them to action."
ENFP,"Strong social conscience. Often active in social movements, They stand up for what they believe in without apology. Some people talk the compassion game but don’t follow through with meaningful action, but They believe it is vitally important to back up caring words with good deeds. Despite their friendly nature, an XXXX will go supernova with righteous anger when they are exposed to suffering and injustice. They can get quite loud and assertive, if that’s what it takes to get their opinions heard."
ENFP,"Hypersensitivity. They sometimes let their imaginations run wild and often perceive bad intentions that don’t really exist. Being hyper-alert and aware helps They improve their social comprehension, but reading between the lines only works when something is actually hidden there. If it isn’t, misunderstandings can occur and hurt feelings can damage good relationships."
ENFP,"Lack of focus and follow through. They are endlessly creative, capable of filling a thousand days with a thousand bold ideas. But they don’t always follow through on their inspirations, and if others are not brought on board to handle the details, their best ideas may never be put into practice. They rely on their initial excitement and passion too much and don’t always show the discipline necessary to translate their ideas into real-world production. They have a tendency to start new projects before the last ones are finished, and failing to see things through is where They sometimes come up short."
ENFP,"Overthink things. They have a tendency to perceive slights, resentments or hostility where none actually exist, and their habit of overanalyzing other people’s behavior can lead to unnecessary anger and conflict. If They aren’t receiving as many compliments as they expect from their significant others, their insecurities can be activated and they may start to feel unappreciated and unloved."
ENFP,"Overemotional and approval-seeking. While emotional expression is a core part of the XXXX's identity, they can come on too strong. The bubbly, energetic style of They doesn’t mesh well with every partner and introverts, in particular, can sometimes feel steamrolled in their presence. They are also approval-seekers, and in their desire to receive praise and acknowledgment they may try a little too hard to make a good impression, talking too much and listening too little in the process."
ENFP,"Accept the fact that if it looks like a duck, swims like a duck and quacks like a duck ... They are intuitive and have a sharp eye for detail. They make a mistake, however, when they insist on looking for hidden motivations or covert agendas everywhere. In normal social encounters, They should make a real effort to give everyone the benefit of the doubt and take words and actions at face value. Assuming the worst can be a self-fulfilling prophecy, since people will eventually sense an XXXX’s mistrust and return it in kind."
ENFP,"Take the foot off the accelerator. In social situations, that is. When They are tempted to turn on the charm just a bit more, or pick up the intensity in their presentation style, they would be wise to resist those urges. Smiling and nodding and listening are excellent communication tools. Interestingly, because they are so good with words, They actually need fewer of them to make their points or establish solid human connections in most instances."
ENFP,"Don’t shirk the “dirty” work. They don’t always see projects through to the end, preferring to hop from one endeavor to another like a hungry hummingbird flitting through a juicy flower patch. So every once in a while, as a change of pace, They should make it a point to maintain tight control all the way to the finish. Detail work and project management do not always come naturally to They. But they have the insight and know-how to handle all the small stuff, if they just make the decision to put their noses to the grindstone and keep them there until the process is complete."
ENFP,"Look inside for validation. They enjoy compliments and try very hard to please, and this has a subtle, and not entirely positive, effect on their behavior. When They pay too much attention to the opinions of others, it can prevent them from following their own instincts and leave them open to manipulation. “If being true to myself gets me in hot water, then so be it”—that is what They should tell themselves when they start worrying too much about what other people think."
ENFP,"Find good partners. Because they are a little lax with the details, They need assistants and co-workers who can handle the duties they tend to overlook. They enjoy working in teams so it should not be a big stretch to form relationships or partnerships with people whose skills complement their own. In their personal lives, They can also benefit by making connections with those who are good at the aspects of life they neglect. This could certainly be said about any of us, but They have a strong independent streak and may not reach out to others for help as often as they should."
ENFP,"At work, the XXXX is concerned with using their creativity to express themselves and benefit others. They want to explore the possibilities for themselves and other people, and approach their work with vision and inspiration. They enjoy taking on creative or people-centered problems that call for an imaginative, original solution."
ENFP,"They are often motivated by their beliefs in humanitarian causes and want work that is consistent with their values. They are particularly interested in helping other people develop as individuals. They tend to choose careers that allow them to pursue ideals of personal growth and artistic expression."
ENFP,"They dislike routine work and want a variety of tasks and challenges. They prefer to set their own schedule and chafe when saddled with excessive regulations or mundane details. They seek out fun, novel tasks that allow them to be imaginative and relate to other people in an unstructured, supportive way."
ENFP,"The ideal work environment for an XXXX is relaxed and friendly, with few restrictions on creativity. The ideal job for an XXXX allows them to follow their inspiration, satisfy their curiosity, and develop solutions that benefit people in innovative and original ways."
ENFP,"They are happiest in their careers when they can deploy their vivacious, person-centered nature to express themselves and help others. They can be found in a wide variety of careers and industries, but the most satisfied They have found a way to bring creativity and originality into their daily work."
ENFP,"They are enthusiastic, involved team members who are interested in exploring the possibilities for innovation. They enjoy relating to people and hearing their ideas—the more imaginative, the better. Although they are open-minded, they are fundamentally grounded in a sense of values, and look for the principles and motivations behind their teammates’ ideas. They have little interest in rules, and will encourage their teammates to think outside the box to create a solution that is uniquely theirs. They want to encourage other people to be creative and find their own voice."
ENFP,"They are most focused on relationships and on ideas, and may have friction with more task-oriented teammates. They relish the task of brainstorming possibilities and options for a project, and are sometimes reluctant to settle on a course of action and move on. They typically shy away from taking on responsibility for details, and can best contribute to a team with their considerable interpersonal skills. They are energetic in their commitment to the group’s mission, and are often good at motivating others and encouraging them to use their talents."
ENFP,"In leadership positions, They convey enthusiasm and excitement for their ideas. Their leadership style tends to be democratic and flexible, with an eye toward developing human potential. They enjoy helping others grow as employees and as people, and grant plenty of freedom to their reports to develop innovative and unique solutions. XXXX leaders motivate with their passion for their ideas and beliefs, and they are often insightful in their assessments of people problems."
ENFP,"Because they are so focused on their ideals, XXXX leaders can sometimes neglect the practicalities of implementation. They are more focused on people than on process, and can lose sight of the ultimate goal as they explore relationships and human development. They may need to develop planning and organizational skills to ensure that their creative ideas become reality."
ENFP,"In relationships, the XXXX is warm, encouraging, and emotionally engaged. They connect with others by sharing their feelings and experiences. They are expressive with their mates and want their mates to share openly with them."
ENFP,"They place great importance on personal development; they encourage their mates to pursue their dreams and want the same encouragement back. They are accepting of their partners as individuals and are unlikely to pressure their partners into being or doing anything in particular. On the rare occasion that they object to a mate's behavior, it's likely to be because their values have been violated."
ENFP,"Although they are quite sensitive, They can be guarded when it comes to their deepest feelings. They dislike conflict and are likely to withdraw rather than engage in a difficult discussion. They are flexible and supportive, and would rather find a way to connect than butt heads. They are creative problem-solvers, and can often come up with original ways to compromise."
ENFP,"They can sometimes be unpredictable, as they follow their inspiration wherever it leads. They can seem unreliable, although they are usually very responsive when a partner is emotionally in need. The ideal mate for an XXXX supports their creativity and caring for others, and expresses appreciation for the XXXX's unique qualities openly and often."
ENFP,"As parents, They are creative and devoted. They enjoy creating new experiences for their families and want to inspire their children to grow as individuals. Although they can be very passionate in their ideas about correct behavior, they are not often strong disciplinarians; they value close relationships above all else and may avoid discipline for fear that it will distance them from their children."
ENFP,"They deeply value their role as parents. However, they tire quickly when subjected to mundane chores and demands from their children. They get the most joy out of parenting when they are connecting emotionally with their children and joining them to explore possibilities for the future."
ENFP,"They are enthusiastic, collaborative communicators who love exploring possibilites for people. They often enjoy getting to know other people and understanding what inspires them, and they are insightful about solutions to personal problems. Highly empathic, the XXXX can find something to identify with in almost every person they meet, and enjoys encouraging other people to develop and grow. They are typically optimistic and like to talk about opportunities for the future, motivating others to join them in their vision." 
INTJ,"They are analytical problem-solvers, eager to improve systems and processes with their innovative ideas. They have a talent for seeing possibilities for improvement, whether at work, at home, or in themselves."
INTJ,"Often intellectual, They enjoy logical reasoning and complex problem-solving. They approach life by analyzing the theory behind what they see, and are typically focused inward, on their own thoughtful study of the world around them. They are drawn to logical systems and are much less comfortable with the unpredictable nature of other people and their emotions. They are typically independent and selective about their relationships, preferring to associate with people who they find intellectually stimulating."
INTJ,"They are perceptive about systems and strategy, and often understand the world as a chess board to be navigated. They want to understand how systems work, and how events proceed: the XXXX often has a unique ability to foresee logical outcomes. They enjoy applying themselves to a project or idea in depth, and putting in concentrated effort to achieve their goals."
INTJ,"They have a hunger for knowledge and strive to constantly increase their competence; they are often perfectionists with extremely high standards of performance for themselves and others. They tend to have a keen interest in self-improvement and are lifelong learners, always looking to add to their base of information and awareness."
INTJ,"They are typically reserved and serious, and seem to spend a lot of time thinking. They are curious about the world around them and often want to know the principle behind what they see. They thoroughly examine the information they receive, and if asked a question, will typically consider it at length before presenting a careful, complex answer. They think critically and clearly, and often have an idea about how to do something more efficiently. They can be blunt in their presentation, and often communicate in terms of the larger strategy, leaving out the details."
INTJ,"Although They aren’t usually warm or particularly gregarious, they tend to have a self-assured manner with people based on their own security in their intelligence. They relate their ideas with confidence, and once they have arrived at a conclusion they fully expect others to see the wisdom in their perceptions. They are typically perfectionists and appreciate an environment of intellectual challenge. They enjoy discussing interesting ideas, and may get themselves into trouble because of their take-no-prisoners attitude: if someone’s beliefs don’t make logical sense, the Mastermind typically has no qualms about pointing that out.. On personality trait measures, score as Discreet, Industrious, Logical, Deliberate, Self-Confident, and Methodical. Among types least likely to suffer heart disease and cardiac problems. Least likely of all the types to believe in a higher spiritual power. One of two types with highest college GPA. Among types with highest income. Personal values include Achievement. Of all types, least likely to state that they value Home/family, Financial security, Relationships & friendships, and Community service. Overrepresented among MBA students and female small business owners. Commonly found in scientific or technical fields, computer occupations, and legal professions"
INTJ,"Popular hobbies for the XXXX include reading, cultural events, taking classes, appreciating art, computers and video games, and independent sports such as swimming, backpacking, or running marathons."
INTJ,"Strategy. They not only see the plan or course of action, they are ready and prepared with several back-ups depending on the various circumstances that could possibly arise. With their expansive, future-focused vision for seeing possibilities and recognizing potential, they are also detailed and logical enough to see holes, gaps and inconsistencies."
INTJ,"Innovation. Though the XXXX may outwardly appear intractable, as a type they are actually quite receptive to and supportive of change and innovation, and this open approach helps to enhance their problem-solving savvy. They believe that most people, processes and systems have the potential to be improved upon and they will seek new and creative ways to try to bring about that change."
INTJ,"Determination. They are revered for their bravery and steadfastness in the face of challenge. They are characteristically determined in whatever they are doing, even to the point of relentless, and are not afraid to move in to tackle the really difficult challenges. Rather than feeling daunted or frustrated, this excites and exhilarates them. They trust their judgment and are confident in their ability to solve the problems and overcome the challenges they encounter in their personal or professional lives."
INTJ,"Willingness to Learn. They aren’t only looking to change externals and other people. They are also diligently committed to working on themselves. Though they won’t typically dwell long upon their feelings and emotional state, they are fully engaged in the work of self-improvement. They are lifelong learners and will always be looking for ways to increase their knowledge and skills."
INTJ,"Superiority. The XXXX’s prowess in the area of intellect, logic and reason is unarguable and definitely among their chief strengths, as is their confidence in their ideas. However, these strengths can turn into weaknesses when they morph into a superiority complex. Unfortunately, among They, this is not uncommon. They may be arrogant and condescending, as well as impatient with people who don’t catch on as quickly as they’d like. With those who demonstrate less ability to think logically and rationally, they may be particularly judgmental and intolerant."
INTJ,"Emotional Distance. They are also known for their low EQ and unwillingness to engage the emotions—their own or others. Preferring to conceptualize the world on a logical, rational basis, they tend to have little patience for emotional concerns. They struggle to pick up on and respond to the emotional cues and needs of others. This can stifle interpersonal relationships, as well as their own growth and development, and may end up keeping others at (at least) arm’s distance."
INTJ,"Perfectionism. While the meticulousness of the XXXX can be a strength, as in all things, too much of a strength can easily become a weakness, and for the XXXX, this natural fastidiousness quickly becomes perfectionism, and in this they can be quite fierce and painstaking. Their standards in general are exacting and this critique may be directed not only toward themselves, but toward others as well."
INTJ,"Imbalance. The XXXX places a high priority on work and will be quite devoted to his or her professional life. But this comes at a price, namely in time that might be spent on family, other relationships and leisure. It is easy for the XXXX to find him or herself with misplaced priorities and, as a result, relational problems. While their drive to succeed professionally can certainly pay off, it can take a toll on the rest of their lives."
INTJ,"Go outside of themselves. They are internal processors and accustomed to finding the right answers or the best plans within their own minds. However, such a constant internal focus can mean the XXXX may miss important details, as well as the potentially insightful and helpful contributions of others. To improve their own ideas and plans, They should seek input from friends, family and colleagues. Though the XXXX has full confidence in his or her own abilities, conferencing with others can breathe new life into a stale approach and can help to uncover blind spots."
INTJ,"Go inside. They don’t naturally introspect deeply or spend much time considering their emotional state. They focus internally on their many ideas and abstract concepts, but when it comes to looking at themselves and their feelings, they often avoid the activity. Out of touch with their own blind spots and character defects, They can be quick to find fault with others. One solution is to work on cultivating humility and compassion."
INTJ,"Balance. It is easy for the XXXX to become completely consumed with work or some project or plan that he or she has devised. In the moment, this will feel exhilarating for the individual, but may have consequences for personal wellbeing and relationships in the long run. The XXXX should strive for better work-life balance. That also means, as mentioned, taking time to examine his or her emotions and responses. It won’t come naturally, but will help interpersonal relationships immensely."
INTJ,"Pick their battles. It is not necessary to argue every single point, though the XXXX’s Thinking nature will compel him or her to do so. This is the default response of their perfectionistic hyper-logical nature. Thus, to better navigate all areas of life, the individual may need to understand that sometimes you have to let the small things go so you can accomplish the big things in the long run."
INTJ,"If it ain’t broke…and even if it is. The XXXX may need to resist the desire to be continually improving and changing. Their view on potential and possibilities for all products, systems and people, leads them to want to always be fixing and “improving.” What they may not realize is that not all people want to be fixed and not all companies want greater efficiency."
INTJ,"At work, the XXXX excels at creating and implementing innovative solutions to analytical problems. They naturally see possibilities for improvement within complex systems and are organized and determined in implementing their ideas for change."
INTJ,"They are comfortable with abstraction and theory but gain the most satisfaction from turning their ideas into reality. They often enjoy working independently or with a small team, taking measured, strategic steps to implement change."
INTJ,"They enjoy working with logical systems that they can understand in depth. They enjoy the challenge of comprehending complex ideas, and want to understand how they can improve the way things work."
INTJ,"The ideal work environment for an XXXX is logical, efficient, structured, and analytical, with colleagues that are competent, intelligent, and productive. The ideal job for a Mastermind allows them to use their analytical skills to problem-solve in a challenging environment, and to take responsibility for implementing their ideas to create efficient, innovative systems."
INTJ,"They are best suited to careers that allow them to use their logical, orderly reasoning to solve interesting problems. Although they are often drawn to STEM fields, They can also be found in business or even the arts. The common theme for satisfied They, however, is that they must be in a career that provides an intellectual challenge."
INTJ,"They are analytical team members who focus on strategy. They are often perceptive about systems and how to improve them. They are thoughtful and clear in their analysis, and good at defining team goals. They are capable of synthesizing ideas of some complexity, and often see clearly to a unifying plan of action. They take a characteristically critical approach, and analyze ideas and proposals with a detached, objective logic. They want to be free to make improvements to existing systems, and do best on a team where change is favored."
INTJ,"They are open to ideas, and will consider the perspectives of the team members with an even-handed approach. However, they are firm and clear in their logical analysis, and have little patience for nonsense. They are unlikely to offer support or assurance to teammates who they don’t perceive as useful contributors. They are persuasive in their reasoning and often get teammates on board based on the clarity of their ideas. However, they may have friction with team members who have a focus on relationships; the Mastermind seeks a free exchange of ideas, not a personal connection."
INTJ,"In leadership positions, They are strategic, analytical planners and problem solvers. They are good at making tough decisions and sorting out complex issues. Masterminds excel at managing projects that implement a vision of improved efficiency or innovation, and although they usually prefer not to have to manage other people, they will take over if no other leader steps up. As leaders, they are democratic and hands-off: they generally prefer to share the overall goal and let their reports determine exactly how to complete their work."
INTJ,"They value competence and decisiveness, and may sometimes neglect to listen to differing opinions once their mind is made up. While they focus on creating logical and innovative solutions, they may sometimes leave out the details of their plans, leaving their teams to wonder exactly how things will be accomplished."

They often have clear ideas about what makes for a solid relationship and are unwavering in their pursuit of this ideal."
INTJ,"They often have a passion for self-improvement and are encouraging of their partners' goals and intellectual pursuits. However, they do not usually see the need for frivolous affection or romance, feeling that their devotion should be evident. They are more focused on serving their partners with hard work and resourceful problem-solving than they are on showering them with attention."
INTJ,"They' partners often find them difficult to read, and indeed they do not show emotion easily; they find the process of discussing emotions much too messy and disorganized. They enjoy solving difficult problems, but are often out of their depth when it comes to illogical, unpredictable personal issues."
INTJ,"They value a partner that allows them the independence to achieve their goals, and one who appreciates their efficacy, insight, and ability to offer creative solutions to problems."
INTJ,"As parents, They are devoted and supportive.

They often love working with others toward a common goal, but may not find time to attend to their feelings. They are focused on results and want to be productive, competent, and influential."
ENTJ,"They are natural leaders, and often take charge no matter where they are. They typically have a clear vision for the future, and intuitively understand how to move people and processes towards that goal. They tend to approach every situation with the attitude of an efficiency analyst, and are not shy about pointing out what could be done better. For the XXXX, their ideas are a foregone conclusion: it’s just a matter of time before they can move the players to get everything accomplished."
ENTJ,"They are often gregarious, and seem to have an idea for how a person will fit into their grand scheme from the moment they are introduced.

ENTJ,"Popular hobbies for They include taking leadership positions in community groups, attending social gatherings or sporting events, and playing competitive sports. Because They are so often focused on their careers, they may have few interests outside of work, or they may participate in leisure activities that also help to further their careers."
ENTJ,"Strong willed. One thing that is especially admirable about They is their near imperviousness to criticism. Once they have formed a position or made a decision, they don’t buckle under pressure. They are just that certain of the rightness of their beliefs and the deft logic that brought them there. To sway They, you must either outsmart them or prove them wrong. They don’t mind being criticized, don’t take things personally and are not afraid to hold the outside opinion."
ENTJ,"Efficient. They are known for their sheer productivity, efficiency and focus, often being able to handle many tasks without dropping or defaulting on any of them. They have limitless energy for their work and they produce more than favorable results.

Rather than being overwhelmed by problems, they are energized by them. These qualities combine with their strong conceptual skills to ensure that every project moves forward with smart, long-term solutions."
ENTJ,"Charismatic leaders. They live in a world of possibilities and see challenges everywhere that they gladly attack. They are leaders in the best sense, using their energy and charisma to inspire and motivate others. People often choose They be their leaders, and this allows They to achieve ambitious plans they could never achieve on their own."
ENTJ,"Blunt and dominant. Given their logical way of thinking, it's no surprise that They are expert at finding flaws and holes. But when combined with their characteristic bluntness and lack of regard for the feelings of others, it can make them appear critical, nitpicky and unrelenting. Not everyone will appreciate having their flaws so frequently picked out and put on display."
ENTJ,"Intolerant. They hold others to their same impossible standards, believing everyone can and should work as hard as they do. They often lack patience for people who are naturally less direct or a bit slower. “It’s my way or the highway” can be an intimidating mantra for those on the sharp end of the XXXX’s criticism."
ENTJ,"Arrogant. They respect strategic thinking, quick wits and decisive action, and look down on those who don’t match up. While being sure of yourself can only be a good thing, it often translates to arrogance, especially in the eyes of those who have not put in as much effort and don’t have the same courage in their convictions."
ENTJ,"Poor handling of emotions. Empathy is not one of the strengths of the XXXX. This type tends to be impatient when others refuse or are unable to see things from their perspective, and it requires active attention from the XXXX to recognize the value of others' opinions and to take their feelings into account. In a personal environment, They can behave imperiously and trample over others’ feelings, which made not win them any friends."
ENTJ,"Get in touch with emotions—their own and others’. They can stand to intentionally work on raising their EQ a few points. Otherwise they come off as abrasive and unfeeling and their relationships fail to develop properly. They can make progress by working to consider their own feelings and those of other people, but it won’t come naturally."
ENTJ,"Practice restraint. Yes, it is important to be right, but this isn’t the only concern. It is important to also consider the personal consequences. Truth and results are important, but They will do well to consider how their actions and decisions will affect the people around them or society at large."
ENTJ,"Value people. Ideas, causes and convictions are important, but the XXXX will be happier in the long run if he or she does not completely jettison personal relations and the feelings of others in the quest to be right or to hold to his or her convictions. And it is possible to enjoy the company and friendship of someone with whom one does not agree on all matters and who also doesn’t desire to argue about it."
ENTJ,"Listen up. They must work on listening and not just for the purpose of arguing in return. They, using their combination of intuition and rapid processing, tend to finish sentences, interrupt, anticipate information and make assumptions. They will benefit by slowing down, listening, waiting for others to finish and trying to pay attention to the details—they might actually be important."
ENTJ,"Relax! The pace of the XXXX is rigorous and They often fail to see the need for leisure or rest. But their work schedule, high intensity and perfectionism can cause them to neglect their health and have negative consequences for them and their families. Thus, it is necessary to build leisure, fun, social interaction and rest into their lives without feeling guilty about the time they may be spending away from work. And they are likely to find that their work is better for it in the long run."
ENTJ,"They are drawn to leadership positions that allow them to develop strategies to achieve greater efficiency and productivity. They prefer to be in management or supervisory roles, and want the ability to initiate and lead organizational change."

ENTJ,"They are objective thinkers who are willing to consider many options, and typically listen to their teammates’ ideas openly. They are good at synthesizing information and can often incorporate many ideas into a single plan of action. Although They are open to ideas, they are also decisive, and may take it upon themselves to deem when a discussion has been concluded.

ENTJ,"They are focused on long range plans and vision, and lead their teams systematically towards their goal. They enjoy attacking tough problems, and want to organize people and resources strategically to achieve goals on time.

They do best leading no-nonsense, goal-oriented teams who share their desire to get to work."

ENTJ,"They prefer to have their homes and lives structured and organized, and may be domineering in imposing this structure on others. They tend to have a clear idea of how things should be done, and may feel that others should follow."
ENTJ,"They are enthusiastic and analytical problem-solvers, and will approach conflict head-on. They are unemotional in sorting out issues, and weigh perspectives with a logical detachment. They may neglect to attend to their partner's feelings, preferring to arrive at conclusions with objective logic. They can also have trouble listening patiently, because of their strong desire to problem-solve."

They often ensure that what time they do spend with their children is well used, and allows them to instill values of hard work, productivity, and achievement."

They see flaw in ideas and plans quickly and give critique freely.

ENTP,"They are inspired innovators, motivated to find new solutions to intellectually challenging problems. They are curious and clever, and seek to comprehend the people, systems, and principles that surround them. Open-minded and unconventional, Visionaries want to analyze, understand, and influence other people."
ENTP,"They enjoy playing with ideas and especially like to banter with others. They use their quick wit and command of language to keep the upper hand with other people, often cheerfully poking fun at their habits and eccentricities. While the XXXX enjoys challenging others, in the end they are usually happy to live and let live. They are rarely judgmental, but they may have little patience for people who can't keep up."
ENTP,"They are energized by challenge and are often inspired by a problem that others perceive as impossible to solve. They are confident in their ability to think creatively, and may assume that others are too tied to tradition to see a new way. The Visionary relies on their ingenuity to deal with the world around them, and rarely finds preparation necessary. They will often jump into a new situation and trust themselves to adapt as they go."
ENTP,"They are masters of re-inventing the wheel and often refuse to do a task the same way twice. They question norms and often ignore them altogether. Established procedures are uninspiring to the Visionary, who would much rather try a new method (or two) than go along with the standard."
ENTP,"They are typically friendly and often charming. They usually want to be seen as clever and may try to impress others with their quick wit and incisive humor. They are curious about the world around them, and want to know how things work. However, for the XXXX, the rules of the universe are made to be broken. They like to find the loopholes and figure out how they can work the system to their advantage. This is not to say the Visionary is malicious: they simply find rules limiting, and believe there is probably a better, faster, or more interesting way to do things that hasn’t been thought of before."
ENTP,"The XXXX is characteristically entrepreneurial and may be quick to share a new business idea or invention. They are confident and creative, and typically excited to discuss their many ingenious ideas. The XXXX’s enthusiasm for innovation is infectious, and they are often good at getting other people on board with their schemes. However, they are fundamentally “big-picture” people, and may be at a loss when it comes to recalling or describing details. They are typically more excited about exploring a concept than they are about making it reality, and can seem unreliable if they don’t follow through with their many ideas. . On personality trait scales, scored as Enterprising, Friendly, Resourceful, Headstrong, Self-Centered, and Independent. Least likely of all types to suffer heart disease and hypertension. Least likely of all types to report stress associated with family and health. Scored among highest of all types in available resources for coping with stress. Overrepresented among those with Type A behavior. Among highest of all types on measures of creativity. One of two types most frequent among violators of college alcohol policy.

ENTP,"Popular hobbies for the XXXX include continuing education, writing, art appreciation, playing sports, computers and video games, travel, and cultural events."
ENTP,"Fearlessness. One of the XXXX’s greatest strengths and keys to success is his or her boldness in the face of challenge. These are people who are not afraid to try and fail and try again, perhaps thousands of times; they don’t conceive of it as failure, merely another step along the path to success. As they invent and innovate, they are undeterred by doubts, they are barely ruffled when outcomes don’t go as planned and they see all “problems” as opportunities to be embraced and pursued."
ENTP,"Innovation. In all things—products, procedures and systems—They know there is always a better way and with the right kind of thinking, they will get there. As a result, they may suffer a lot of seeming failures in their lives, but will enjoy many successes as well. They can be marvelously rich and lose their entire life savings—perhaps a few times within the course of their lives. They live out loud and take risks."
ENTP,"Adaptability. They are generally go-with-the-flow people. This isn’t to say that they are particularly agreeable individuals, but that they are able to adapt to their circumstances and the problems that arise in life and work. They can improvise on the fly and come up with creative solutions rapidly. They deal well with fast-paced and frequent change and enjoy the corresponding challenges."
ENTP,"Confidence. Generally speaking, criticism and ostracism have very little effect on They. They are confident in their skills and talents and believe in the power of their ideas. Opposition on the way to success is to be expected and they don’t take it personally; they’d rather prove their detractors wrong."
ENTP,"Flightiness. That which is a strength can easily become a weakness and this is seen in the case of They and their idea-generating nature. While this can be the XXXX’s greatest strength, it can also mean that the XXXX may be flighty and flaky, jumping from one idea to the next and struggling to follow through. Their fear of missing out can make it hard to commit to one idea or one path; they want to keep exploring and evaluating."
ENTP,"Impracticality. They have a chaotic air about them that can range from amusing to aggravating, especially to coworkers and spouses. In their tendency to get caught up in their ideas they often lose sight of the immediate tasks around them such as house work, yard work and other responsibilities of daily living, such as paying bills. An XXXX may be stunningly brilliant but also poor, disorganized and seemingly untethered."
ENTP,"Breaking norms. Nonconformity, while it can be a positive trait, often gets the XXXX into trouble. Their entire approach to life is founded upon charting their own course, pushing the boundaries and doing things their way. While this leads to great creativity and advances in their fields, in can also put them at odds with authority figures and superiors, which can, in turn, hinder their progress and impede their success. “Incorrigible” and “stubborn” are two words that wouldn’t be out of place in describing a typical INFJ,"
ENTP,"Procrastination. They are also known for their tendencies toward procrastination and poor time management. To some degree, this is a product of their Perceiving component in which they prefer to continue taking in information rather than making a decision and getting down to business. The issue is not necessarily laziness as much as it is a disinclination to stop the intake of ideas and information in order to move forward with one idea or one decision. They have a hard time prioritizing tasks and will struggle to keep new information and ideas from getting in the way of the work at hand."
ENTP,"Do a little more research. They are quick to dive into new projects and ideas headfirst. While this enthusiastic “all in” quality can be a strength, it can also be detrimental when people of this type fail to do the due diligence or to pay adequate attention to the details. The XXXX can help avoid wasted time and money by stepping back and investigating first."
ENTP,"Look at the “small picture.” As big-picture people and conceptual thinkers, people of this type are focused on the broad themes and patterns and the big, important projects, often letting the details fall by the wayside. However details—while nothing more than a bother to the XXXX—are often essential. They will do well to realize that details often end up eating more time in the long run if neglected or overlooked."
ENTP,"Learn to adapt to rules and structures. Rules aren’t actually made to be broken, contrary to the XXXX’s belief, and the people who follow them aren’t to be disdained as thoughtless or unintelligent. These boundaries provide order. If everyone disregarded them we’d be living in very different circumstances. They will get along better at work and in society if they can try to have a little respect for authority and follow the rules."
ENTP,"Stick to it. They generate so many different ideas and interesting options that they simply want to explore them all. While this can be an asset, it also can deter them from simply getting on with the work at hand. At some point, in order to be most productive, the XXXX needs to make a decision on a course of action, plot the steps to the finish and then just get going."
ENTP,"Differentiate between the possible and the probable. They often don’t properly distinguish between these two categories and thus find themselves spending a wealth of resources pursuing something that, though possible, is not at all probable. People of this type will do well to factor in the feasibility of various ideas when considering their many options."
ENTP,"At work, the XXXX is concerned with applying innovative solutions to challenging problems to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of systems. They often take an entrepreneurial approach to their work and they prefer to approach tasks in a casual and unstructured way, with few limitations on their ingenuity."

The ideal job for an XXXX allows them to put their creativity to work developing innovative ideas, while allowing them to delegate responsiblity for the tedious details of implementation to others."
ENTP,"They are ingenious, entrepreneurial team members who want to explore new and creative ideas. Flexible and adaptable, the XXXX wants to discover the best way to do something, and is often excited by an opportunity to innovate. They are generally energetic and optimistic, and confident in their ability to solve difficult problems. They often feel the best solutions come from skirting or even ignoring the rules, and rarely have much interest in adhering to the established procedures. They may have considerable friction with teammates who take a more traditional approach."
ENTP,"They are typically open-minded, and like to hear many perspectives on an issue. They are good at synthesizing information and often show a talent for incorporating the best of many ideas into one, unified concept. However, they can be competitive, and sometimes like to take the credit for a team’s successes. They are rarely good at hammering out details, and may want to take ownership for the group’s overall direction, while leaving the exact specifications of the plan to their teammates."
ENTP,"In leadership positions, They are imaginative and enterprising. XXXX leaders tend to be intellectually competitive, and want a team that can keep up. They are likely to encourage independence and creative thinking among their reports, but will subject any new ideas, including their own, to a thorough and critical analysis."
ENTP,"They look for trends, and want to have plenty of information and data available in their search for patterns and principles. They tend to be focused on systems more than people, and may neglect their team's emotional needs in the pursuit of knowledge, understanding, and innovation. When they do focus on personal concerns, their strength lies in strategy rather than diplomacy, and they often use their understanding of human behavior to engineer and influence social systems."
ENTP,"In relationships, the XXXX is inventive, enthusiastic, and spontaneous. They are often exciting partners, full of ideas for new things to explore together."
ENTP,"They prize their ability to understand others and communicate effectively, and have an ongoing interest in improving themselves and their relationships. They want to know how their partners' minds work, and are creative in coming up with solutions to interpersonal problems."
ENTP,"They like to encourage their mates to pursue their ambitions. However, they may be competitive or even argumentative; they enjoy a good debate for its own sake. They typically need a partner who is emotionally resilient and doesn't take offense at their intellectual challenges."
ENTP,"They can be unreliable as they follow their inspiration, wherever it may lead. They have little interest in order or routine, and may neglect mundane household chores as they pursue more stimulating activities. The ideal mate for an XXXX appreciates their ingenuity, competence, and perceptiveness, and supports them in their ever-changing interests, schemes, and social pursuits."
ENTP,"As parents, They are concerned with developing their children as independent thinkers. They are fun-loving parents who want to give their children many experiences to help their young minds expand and grow. More interested in challenging their children intellectually than caring for their physical needs, the XXXX is inclined to leave the day-to-day details of childrearing up to another parent if possible."
ENTP,"Although XXXX parents may be distracted from their families when other interests capture their attention, they derive great joy from offering their children many and varied opportunities to develop."
ENTP,"They are lively and agile communicators who speak in terms of the “big idea.” They like to explore possibilities and make connections with the information they receive. They love innovative solutions and are enthusiastic about change, but they are also highly analytical and will not hesitate to criticize ideas that don’t hold up to their logical analysis. They can be hard to keep up with in conversation; they like to play with lots of complex ideas and have little patience for explaining details."
INTP,"They are philosophical innovators, fascinated by logical analysis, systems, and design. They are preoccupied with theory, and search for the universal law behind everything they see. They want to understand the unifying themes of life, in all their complexity."
INTP,"They are detached, analytical observers who can seem oblivious to the world around them because they are so deeply absorbed in thought. They spend much of their time focused internally: exploring concepts, making connections, and seeking understanding. To the Architect, life is an ongoing inquiry into the mysteries of the universe."
INTP,"They present a cool exterior but are privately passionate about reason, analysis, and innovation. They seek to create complex systems of understanding to unify the principles they've observed in their environments. Their minds are complicated and active, and they will go to great mental lengths trying to devise ingenious solutions to interesting problems."
INTP,"The XXXX is typically non-traditional, and more likely to reason out their own individual way of doing things than to follow the crowd. The XXXX is suspicious of assumptions and conventions, and eager to break apart ideas that others take for granted. They are merciless when analyzing concepts and beliefs, and hold little sacred. They are often baffled by other people who remain loyal to ideology that doesn't make logical sense."
INTP,"They are often thoroughly engaged in their own thoughts, and usually appear to others to be offbeat and unconventional. The XXXX’s mind is a most active place, and their inward orientation can mean that they neglect superficial things like home décor or appropriate clothing. They don’t tend to bother with small talk but can become downright passionate when talking about science, mathematics, computers, or the larger theoretical problems of the universe. Reality is often of only passing interest to the Architect, as they are more interested in the theory behind it all."
INTP,"They are typically precise in their speech, and communicate complex ideas with carefully chosen words. They insist on intellectual rigor in even the most casual of conversations, and will readily point out inconsistencies of thought or reasoning. Social niceties may fall by the wayside for an XXXX who is more interested in analyzing logic, and they may offend others by submitting their dearly held values and beliefs to logical scrutiny. .

INTP,"Analytically brilliance. Beneath the quiet surface sits an intellectual prowess which They bring to any environment in which they find themselves. They are fast thinkers and highly logical. Others may not know it since much happens inside the XXXX’s own own head, yet this type excels in analyzing connections between seemingly random pieces of information and finding flawless explanations to problems that disorient most other personality types."
INTP,"Objective. They are respected for their relentless pursuit of truth, objectivity and understanding. They make this the goal of their lives and channel their energy into rooting out errors and eliminating inconsistencies. They do this not only for their own personal enjoyment but because they see it as their main contribution to the world in whatever field they may find themselves."
INTP,"Imaginative. They think deeply about theory, how to understand and explain difficult concepts, and how systems and products function and might be improved. They naturally see things others don’t because they have imaginations that are actively focused and fixated on future potential and possibility."
INTP,"Enthusiastic. To others, the XXXX may come across as private and withdrawn but when a topic piques their interest, They can be very enthusiastic⁠—excited even⁠—about discussing it. This excitement makes them fun to be around. In the right company, They are keen to express their imaginative sense of humor, and enjoy being playful with people who they can trust."
INTP,"Uncertainty. Despite their intellectual prowess, They often live in fear of failure, anxious that they will overlook some critical aspect of their theory, idea or invention. This causes them to be self-conscious and to waste time and energy second-guessing themselves."
INTP,"Absent-mindedness. They aren’t labeled “absentminded professors” for no reason. At their worst, they tend to be scattered and disorganized. Intellectual and high-minded, they get caught up in their own brains and fail to deal with the low-level tedium of the here and now such as bills or deadlines. They fail may fail to conform to even the basic expectations of daily life in society."
INTP,"Condescension. A significant weakness of the XXXX is the tendency to be condescending and critical, either of their opponents or those who simply don’t catch on as quickly as they do. Their constant pursuit of truth and objectivity, though admirable, can also provoke brutality and impatience as they drive home their own perspective. This can be especially toxic in relationships in which logic simply does not always reign supreme."
INTP,"Insensitivity. They can get into trouble because of their tendency to prioritize the activity taking place in their minds over the needs of others. They comfortably inhabit the realm of their imaginations and this can bring certain problems, not least that They get so caught up in their own theories and abstractions that they forget any kind of emotional consideration. Their focus on ideas and logic, and neglect of personal considerations, can easily offend."
INTP,"Develop emotional intelligence.Though They can make very good friends and partners, they are not overly warm or attentive to the feelings and emotional cues of others. While emotional receptiveness and responsiveness will not come naturally to people of this type, focusing on key behaviors that help other people to feel heard and cared for will expand the XXXX's ability to relate and connect."
INTP,"Harness the power of relationships. Though they are naturally solitary, They are not at their best when they neglect key relationships. They can easily become isolated, especially if they are working on a difficult problem. While they may be indifferent to how many friends or personal relationships they have, They who can learn to purposely cultivate their social and professional connections will be more successful—and happier in the end."
INTP,"Bring others in. They can easily find themselves rutted or caught in their own blind spots and, given the amount of time they spend in solitude, they may not regularly enjoy the input of others that can help to put them back on course. By bringing other people into their inner worlds, They not only serve their relationships, they also get important feedback that can help them to clarify their high-level ideas and make them understandable and useful to a wider audience."
INTP,"Think practically. This may be a challenge because They are not characteristically utilitarian or particularly pragmatic. This doesn’t mean they don’t value efficiency, but that they believe in the value of thinking and experimenting for its own sake, even if there is no practical value or outcome attached to it. While we need people who are committed to taking on dream projects and experiments simply because they’re good things to do, employers may be less sympathetic. They should step back and consider their projects from a practical stance. Will this idea actually work? Does it matter? Is this a product people would actually use? Does it have practical value?"
INTP,"Become more charitable. They will always be relentless about what is right, true and logical, but can become more charitable with time and effort. This will also involve working to understand and take into account the emotional concerns of others and seeking to develop empathy and compassion. They can start by trying to look at and understand their own emotions."
INTP,"At work, the XXXX is motivated to solve complex problems in an original, innovative way. Architects want to analyze systems and ideas thoroughly to create deep understanding, and enjoy designing creative solutions to highly abstract problems."
INTP,"They rarely have much interest in organizational traditions, preferring to forge their own path to innovation. They hate being limited by bureaucracy and rules, and are often more in tune with the theoretical soundness of their ideas than they are with the practical applications. They typically prefer to focus on creating the idea, and to leave the tedious details of implementation to someone else."
INTP,"They work best independently or with a small team of colleagues that they perceive as smart, competent, and logical. They quickly tire of colleagues who are aggressive or overbearing, and can be dismissive of people who aren't as clever as themselves."
INTP,"An ideal organization for an XXXX is flexible and non-traditional, and values ingenuity over conformity. An ideal job for an XXXX allows them to address complex theoretical or technical problems with creative, novel solutions."
INTP,"They are first and foremost thinkers, and this quality can be seen in their choice of careers. Although They can be found in a wide variety of fields, a happy and satisfied XXXX is invariably found in a career that allows them to use their intellect, analyze concepts, and think deeply."
INTP,"They have an innovative nature and are often drawn to cutting-edge fields such as technology, engineering, and the sciences. Although They overall are a rare breed, visit an area like California's Silicon Valley or a tech company like Google or Apple and you'll find that nearly every other person seems to be an XXXX. This type naturally thrives in the challenging, unpredictable world of tech."
INTP,"Many They are creative and seek an artistic bent to their career. They are particularly drawn to artistic fields with a touch of science or technology, for instance architecture or graphic design."
INTP,"Although They typically prefer careers that have them working with ideas more than people, a contingent of They consider human problems the ultimate frontier of intellectual inquiry. Thus, you find some They in careers that allow them to study the human experience, including psychology and other social sciences."
INTP,"Technology is a highly attractive field for They, and many They are drawn to computers from a very young age. Even They who do not work in tech fields typically nurse an interest in computers on the side. Working with technology allows They to exercise their reasoning skills in perfect concert with their creativity and desire to experiment and innovate. Some They even say they understand computers better than they understand other people!"
INTP,"Engineering careers are a good fit for the logical, analytical thinking style of the XXXX. They particularly enjoy engineering fields that allow them to exercise a measure of creativity in their work."
INTP,"Scientific careers are a natural choice for They. They enjoy all aspects of the sciences: the opportunity to build specialized knowledge in their field of choice; the ability to focus at length on complex, abstract ideas; and most of all, the exploratory process of scientific experimentation."
INTP,"Both business and law careers can make good use of the XXXX's analytical instincts. Good business careers for They often stimulate their interest in complex theories, including advanced mathematics."
INTP,"Some They focus on their creative instincts with a career in the arts. Typically, though, even an XXXX working in an artistic field finds a way to use their analytical side in their work."
INTP,"They are thoughtful, analytical team members who contribute a deep understanding of complex problems. They are often most interested in the theoretical questions behind the team’s goal, and can help the group to identify key principles and generate innovative ideas. They tend to engage with the vision of the team, analyzing it rationally and objectively and offering options and possibilities."
INTP,"They do best on a team when they are given freedom to analyze logical problems in an original way. They are skilled at coming up with creative solutions, but don’t put much stock in the established way of doing things. Team members who are highly loyal to tradition may encounter friction with the XXXX. Architects are typically independent thinkers who’d rather debate ideas than make small talk. They may become impatient if too much time is spent on pleasantries, and may put off team members who seek a more personal touch."
INTP,"In leadership positions, They inspire others with their intelligence and innovative ideas. XXXX leaders are often unassuming on the surface but catch everyone's attention once they begin talking about their ideas. They generally allow their reports a lot of latitude, preferring to set the overall goal and trust their team to solve problems autonomously."
INTP,"They enjoy exploring new possibilities and engaging in creative problem solving, but may sometimes get so caught up in the world of ideas that they neglect to lead their teams into action. They may have trouble hashing out details, and often leave it to someone else to create exact specifications. They do best leading competent, intellectually driven teams who understand their complex ideas and can fill in the details to create realistic plans of action."
INTP,"They are independent and clever partners. They enjoy engaging intellectually and want an intelligent partner who can match their ability to think critically."
INTP,"They have little appetite for the mundane aspects of life, and may disregard the usual rituals of a relationship. They are rarely interested in tradition, preferring instead to design a lifestyle that makes sense for the parties involved—even if it looks highly unconventional to other people. They are tolerant of individual preferences but will rarely do something because they are told they 'should.'"
INTP,"They tend to analyze the theory behind everything, and may interpret human interactions with the detached logic of a psychological researcher. They may find others difficult to deal with when they cannot understand the logic behind their behavior. When things get too emotional, they may retreat to their own world of thoughts and ideas."
INTP,"They want plenty of space in a relationship to explore their own thoughts, ideas, and interests. They value a partner that appreciates their ingenuity and problem-solving ability, and one that understands their need for autonomy."
INTP,"As parents, They encourage competence and independent problem solving. They often do not tune in easily to their children's feelings, but will enthusiastically help them to reason out a complex dilemma."
INTP,"They are usually involved in their own projects or ideas and typically do not take much pleasure in the mundane, day-to-day tasks of caring for children. As a result, the Architect parent may sometimes seem distant to their children, but their true delight in parenting is in sharing exciting ideas and concepts with young minds."
INTP,"They can be insightful communicators, when the subject inspires them. Thoughtful and independent, they may not have a great need for conversation, but when discussing complex concepts or innovative ideas they can become quite intense and display a wealth of information and insight. Logical and analytical, they can weigh possibilities endlessly and are great at playing devil’s advocate. They love to pick apart ideas but are not convinced by anything but the most rational of analyses; they can spot a flaw in logic a mile away, and rarely hesitate to point it out."
ESFJ,"They are conscientious helpers, sensitive to the needs of others and energetically dedicated to their responsibilities. They are highly attuned to their emotional environment and attentive to both the feelings of others and the perception others have of them. They like a sense of harmony and cooperation around them, and are eager to please and provide."
ESFJ,"They value loyalty and tradition, and usually make their family and friends their top priority. They are generous with their time, effort, and emotions. They often take on the concerns of others as if they were their own, and will attempt to put their significant organizational talents to use to bring order to other people's lives."
ESFJ,"They act according to a strict moral code, and look for others to do the same. They often see things in terms of black and white, right and wrong, and they are typically not shy about sharing their evaluations of others' behavior. They seek harmony and cooperation, and feel this is best accomplished when everyone follows the same set of rules. They have a sense of order in the way people relate to one another, and often take on roles that allow them to help enforce that social order."
ESFJ,"They feel a sense of personal responsibility for other people's needs, and are usually eager to get involved and help out. They tend to be serious and practical, dutifully putting business before pleasure—especially the business of caring for others. They typically enjoy routine and often keep a regular schedule that allows them to be organized and productive."
ESFJ,"They may often be found playing host or hostess. They tend to take on the role of organizer without hesitation, and want to be sure that everyone is taken care of. Roles such as committee leader, event planner, and church volunteer suit the XXXX well. They are typically engaged with their communities and work hard to do their part in maintaining the social order. They are interested in other people and like to know the details of their lives. Gossip is a favorite pasttime of many They; they love to share stories about the people around them."
ESFJ,"They have a clear moral code that guides their behavior and their expectations from others. They often have strong opinions about how people should behave and the proper thing to do. Manners and other codes of social interaction are often of great interest to They. They may think in terms of black and white, right and wrong. They can be judgmental of others who they do not think are acting appropriately, but they have the best of intentions: they simply want everyone to follow the rules so they can all get along. The XXXX wants things to be all right with the people around them, and may become very involved with others’ problems and concerns.. Underrepresented among people suffering from substance abuse. Among types highest in resources for coping with stress. Second most likely of all types to report believing in a higher spiritual power. Highest of all types in reported satisfaction with their marriage or intimate relationship. Among most likely of all types to stay in college. Most likely of all types to be satisfied with their co-workers. Values at work include clear structure, security, and the ability to be of service to others. Among the types most satisfied with their work. Commonly found in careers in education, health care, and religion"
ESFJ,"Popular leisure activities for They include volunteering in community, charity, or religious organizations; celebrating holidays and family traditions; cooking; entertaining; and social sports."
ESFJ,"Strong practical skills. Good intentions are wonderful, but they don’t mean much unless they’re backed up by a well- organized plan of action. They understand how to accomplish tasks better than most, and that is why the to-do lists they make are seldom left with any unchecked items. They are so conscientious and detail-oriented they can’t stomach the thought of leaving an important job or project only half-finished, and they would feel embarrassed if they gave anything less than their very best effort in each and every instance."
ESFJ,"Warm and sensitive. With grand and gentle hearts, They form lasting emotional bonds and make strong empathic connections with others. When someone needs guidance, They will be by their side, supporting them with advice that is concrete, sensible and guaranteed to produce good results. No problem is too big or too small to arouse the interest of They, and regardless of what a friend, loved one or acquaintance is going through, They will do their best to provide impactful assistance."
ESFJ,"Loyal and dutiful. They are traditionalists right down to the core. They are concerned with protecting the best parts of the existing social order against the forces of “progress”, and always honor the wisdom of their elders, always put the interests of others before their own. Doing the right thing every time doesn’t make life easy, but They are incapable of following the path of least resistance when people need help or moral issues are involved."
ESFJ,"Stand up and be counted. They aren’t intimidated by challenges and they aren’t willing to just sit by and wait for others to take the lead. Inside their social and community circles, They are always willing to step up and lend a helping hand; in support of great causes they will organize, volunteer, recruit, fundraise, run for election, put up flyers, go door-to-door or give speeches on street corners— sometimes all in the same week!"
ESFJ,"Rigid and judgmental. While they are tolerant in general, They don’t approach the world with a completely open mind. Their value systems are defined by fixed ideas about right and wrong, good and bad, smart and foolish, and they tend to categorize everything they see according to such dualistic concepts. “Live and let live” is not a concept that appeals to They, who are not shy about judging the behavior and character of others based on brief initial impressions."
ESFJ,"Reluctant to improvise. They have a lot or respect for rules, laws, regulations and traditional codes of conduct—a world without shoulds and shouldn’ts and dos and don’ts would be unsustainable and chaotic to the traditionalist XXXX. But in some instances, outside the box thinking may be required. They can be slow to recognize this reality, making them rigid and unyielding when a bit more openness to change is called for."
ESFJ,"Neediness. They have a strong need to be noticed, acknowledged and appreciated, and they want others to see them as helpful, trustworthy and virtuous. This means that their sense of self-worth will rise or fall based on the amount of praise or criticism they get from others. They aren’t worried about what other people will think every minute of the day, but they do take rejection very personally and have a hard time getting over any perceived slight."
ESFJ,"Lack of creative thinking. Too often, They are so focused on the here and now they miss opportunities for growth and improvement that are staring them right in the face. A long view that embraces creative inspirations, abstract ideas and big picture thinking can allow them to reach new levels of understanding, but taking their intellects in this direction does not come naturally to They. A failure to respect the benefits of creative power of the imagination can keep They stuck in patterns of thought and behavior that have long outlived their usefulness."
ESFJ,"Get some emotional separation. Helping others gives They enormous satisfaction but, like sponges, they absorb the anxieties of others as if those troubles were their own. Unfortunately, this is emotionally exhausting and can put a huge strain on They who may become so preoccupied with the suffering and angst of their loved ones that they lose sight of their own personal needs. In the long run, They would be more effective if they could learn to put some emotional distance between themselves and the people they choose to assist."
ESFJ,"Practice “letting go”. Fish are going to swim, birds are going to fly, and They are going to make judgments about people and events based on their own exacting standards. But just because they possess this trait doesn’t mean they have to indulge it in every single instance. If They can learn to detach just a bit from their initial impressions, they will have a much easier time altering their judgments as more information comes in."
ESFJ,"Remember that no one can please all of the people all of the time. They crave the favorable opinions of others and they always go the extra mile to please. But trying to satisfy everyone in every circumstance is impossible, no matter how friendly or accommodating an XXXX might be. The sooner they realize this the better off they will be. Like anything else it takes practice to change attitudes, but learning to accept occasional rejection can help They find greater harmony and peace of mind."
ESFJ,"Practice solo hobbies. They can become overly dependent on other people, to the point where they feel ill-at-ease if there is no one around to talk to. We all need some alone time where we can reflect in peace and silence. Solitary hobbies and activities that require quiet concentration and promote self-reliance are highly recommended for They, who need to get in touch with their feelings and figure out how to get by without constant outside feedback."
ESFJ,"Learn a little more about how rules, laws, regulations and traditions actually came into being. They obey the rules and respect traditional ways. But rather than just accepting them without question, They should consider studying up to understand where they actually came from. Ideas we take for granted now were fresh and innovative at some point in the past, and they often represented a clean break from previous assumptions. Discovering where “self-evident truths” and “common sense” really came from can help They broaden their perspective. And if this makes them a little more open to new ideas in the present, it will be a positive development all the way around."
ESFJ,"They like to put their interpersonal skills to work to organize people and processes. They are tuned into the needs of others and seek to create structure to provide for people. They often prefer work that allows them to help people in practical, observable ways."
ESFJ,"They enjoy work that allows them to follow through and see results, and prefer a high degree of structure and organization. They gain satisfaction from completing tasks with attention to order and detail. An ideal job for an XXXX requires attention to procedure and specifications, and allows the XXXX to work methodically to organize people and processes."
ESFJ,"They usually prefer to work with others, and are energized by participating in a motivated, conscientious, action-oriented team. It is important to the XXXX to do work that is accordant with their values, as well as to work with others who are supportive and cooperative. An ideal work environment for an XXXX provides clear expectations and a friendly, structured atmosphere free from conflict or uncertainty."
ESFJ,"They enjoy the process of teamwork, and engage with others to create an environment of caring and support. They are concerned with getting everyone to contribute, and want to make all team members feel included and valued. They value cooperation and a harmonious team environment. They tend to solicit opinions from everyone and try to organize the tasks of the team to accommodate the needs and priorities of all involved."
ESFJ,"They do best on a structured team, where everyone can be given a well-defined task and the rules of the game are agreed upon. They want to appreciate their teammates’ contributions, but find this easier when those contributions conform to established guidelines. They may have more difficulty with teammates who want to bend the rules or try something new."
ESFJ,"They are most effective when their teams are cooperative and free of conflict. They often do well at bringing everyone together, and may be distracted from the task at hand if there is conflict or competition between team members."
ESFJ,"They are often eager to take charge, and get things done in a structured, orderly way. They want to deliver on time and as promised, and will expect that their teams show this same attention to expectations. They use their communication and organizational skills to coordinate and move a team steadily along toward a goal."
ESFJ,"They motivate by providing their reports with personal attention and ensuring they have the resources and support they need to deliver results. They want their employees to feel appreciated and cared for so that they can be cooperative and productive."
ESFJ,"Tradition is important to They, and they are interested in understanding established procedures and helping their teams to follow existing guidelines. They have a strong respect for organizational hierarchy and expect that their reports will also defer to their authority."
ESFJ,"In relationships, the XXXX is supportive, nurturing, and reliable. They concern themselves with providing practical support to their partners and living up to traditional standards in a relationship: they want to be the 'good wife' or husband based on traditional ideals."
ESFJ,"They like an organized life and want their partners to participate in a structured, scheduled lifestyle. They adhere strictly to their own moral code, and want a partner who agrees with them on issues of right and wrong, should and should not. Conscientiousness is important to the XXXX, and when they follow through responsibly on their promises, they expect the same from others."
ESFJ,"They dislike conflict and are motivated to resolve it quickly. They prefer stable, harmonious relationships and like a partner who is able to be loving and committed, even when the XXXX has strong emotional reactions. They appreciate a partner who notices their efforts to provide for their families, and commends them on a job well done."
ESFJ,"As parents, They provide clear structure and loving boundaries. They are interested in providing a safe and stable home with adequate resources, and in instilling a strong moral code and work ethic into their children. They are extremely devoted to their children, and go to tremendous lengths to be sure they are provided for."
ESFJ,"They often strongly identify with their children’s behavior, feeling tremendous pride when they succeed but an enormous sense of personal failure when they do not. They may become embarrassed and critical of children who do not behave as expected; they want their children to adopt and follow their own strong system of values."
ESFJ,"They are enthusiastic and caring communicators, who want to engage people to contribute and accomplish what needs to be done. They tend to be friendly and to get along easily with others, although they can become frustrated with those who do not respond to their attempts to reach out. They have a good memory for detail, especially facts about other people, and enjoy getting to know people and understanding their needs. They are factual in their communication, but generally uncomfortable with criticism and conflict, preferring instead to provide support and encouragement to others."
ESFP,"They are vivacious entertainers who charm and engage those around them. They are spontaneous, energetic, and fun-loving, and take pleasure in the things around them: food, clothes, nature, animals, and especially people."
ESFP,"They are typically warm and talkative and have a contagious enthusiasm for life. They like to be in the middle of the action and the center of attention. They have a playful, open sense of humor, and like to draw out other people and help them have a good time."
ESFP,"They live in the moment, enjoying what life has to offer. They are especially tuned into their senses and take pleasure in the sights, sounds, smells, and textures around them. They like to keep busy, filling their lives with hobbies, sports, activities, and friends. Because they'd rather live spontaneously than plan ahead, they can become overextended when there are too many exciting things to do. An XXXX hates nothing more than missing out on the fun."
ESFP,"Although they are characteristically fun-loving, They are also typically practical and down-to-earth. They are grounded in reality and are usually keenly aware of the facts and details in their environment, especially as they pertain to people. They are observant of others and their needs, and responsive in offering assistance. They enjoy helping other people, especially in practical, tangible ways."
ESFP,"They are often the life of the party, entertaining and engaging others with humor and enthusiasm. They notice whether other people are having fun, and do their best to create a good time for all. Typically at home in their physical environment, They may take the lead in getting everyone involved in some active diversion. They are generally friendly and likable, but can be hard to get close to; although they tend to be very open, they are reluctant to be serious or to talk about anything negative."
ESFP,"They are tuned into their senses, and often gravitate towards pleasing colors and textures in their environments. They often carefully choose fabrics and decorations with which to surround themselves. This attention also often translates into their appearance; They are often dressed in sensuous fabrics or bright, dazzling colors. They are often up on the latest trends, and like to excite the people around them with new environments and experiences.. On personality trait measures, score as Changeable, Energetic, Forceful, Initiating, and Resourceful. More likely to use emotional coping techniques over spiritual or physical resources. Tend to look to authority in education rather than expressing intellectual curiosity; prefer hands-on learning. Among most likely to stay in college. More likely than other types to watch television for more than 3 hours a day. Second highest of all types in marital satisfaction. Among types with lowest income. At work, tend to be satisfied with co-workers but dissatisfied with job security, stress, salary, and accomplishment. Personal values include Home/Family, Health, Friendships, Financial Security, and Spirituality. Overrepresented in health care, teaching, coaching, and child care occupations"
ESFP,"Popular hobbies for They include socializing, team sports, home improvement projects, cooking, entertaining, games, and dance. They love big parties and gatherings and are quick to join any group or activity that sounds like fun."
ESFP,"Showmanship. They have lively personalities which they use to liven up every room they occupy. Bringing smiles and enjoyment to others gives the XXXX greater satisfaction than anything else in the world. Being cheerful, entertaining and humorous comes naturally to They, and the people who know them best realize their interest in the happiness of others is sincere and motivated by empathetic and compassionate instincts."
ESFP,"Supportive. They do like to be the center of attention, but they also prize the spirit of cooperation and never try to hog the spotlight when asked to work on group projects. It is really the social give-and-take that They enjoy the most, and if they act as facilitators in cooperative situations it is only because their outgoing natures predispose them to take the lead. As teammates or partners, They will always listen to what everyone has to say, will never try to force their ideas on anyone."
ESFP,"Positivity. They are the quintessential positive thinkers, firmly believing the bright side is the only one worth looking at. They see every minute of wasted time as a lost opportunity, and they can’t stand to throw away chances for fun, conversation, excitement or unique experience. Furthermore, they do a fantastic job of passing on their enthusiasm and hopefulness to their companions, and that is why some of the most admired self-help gurus and motivational speakers come from the XXXX ranks."
ESFP,"Bold and practical. Because they refuse to live in the past or the future, or get distracted by dreams or fantasies about the way the world should be, They are high-quality practical workers who never sacrifice their determination to accomplish remarkable things in the present moment. They want desperately to help others, but they also want to see results from their efforts immediately and aren’t willing to be patient. They will put the pedal to the metal in a heartbeat if they see opportunities to make a constructive impact in the lives of the people they care about most."
ESFP,"Avoid conflict. The one problem with “glass half full” types is that they will sometimes deny unpleasant truths or avoid uncomfortable situations if they feel it might cast a dark cloud. They hate buzzkills, and this makes them a bit squeamish about conflict, persistent social problems and a variety of other unfortunate circumstances that can’t be wished away or overcome with a cheerful attitude."
ESFP,"Sensitive. It is ironic given their tendency to showmanship and outspokenness, but They are extremely sensitive and can be deeply hurt when others criticize their ideas, personalities or conduct. They have a tough time seeing such criticism as constructive, and they usually react with anger and resentment when they feel someone is questioning or attacking them."
ESFP,"Easily bored. With a need for constant excitement, They find it hard to maintain their focus on the topic at hand; often demonstrating the sort of attention span normally seen only in kindergarten classrooms. This can make them appear flighty and unfocused. Life is not a non-stop party, and They do need to knuckle down if they are to turn their high energy into an accomplished goal."
ESFP,"Poor long-term focus. When given the choice between theory and proven practice, XXXX will choose the latter every time. They distrust abstract concepts, future hypotheses and big picture projections and this makes them poor long-term planners. They aren’t as good at recognizing alternatives as they should be, and this can blind them to exciting possibilities for growth, evolution and constructive change."
ESFP,"Make lists and write down goals. Too often, the spontaneity and impulsivity of They leads them astray. To avoid spur-of-the-moment decision making, They should try to set goals and organize their activities ahead of time, possibly with the assistance of written lists and schedules. This would give them a clear life plan to refer back to, keeping them on the straight and narrow when faced with temptation."
ESFP,"Don’t ignore the long-term consequences. By focusing on practical matters so intently, They sometimes waste chances to improve their lives and establish long-term goals. We all need to broaden our horizons and step back so we can see things from a greater perspective. They would benefit from undertaking a meaningful dialogue with the dreamers, creators and visionaries in their lives. The more relationships They can form with big picture thinkers the better off they will be."
ESFP,"Assume it’s all constructive criticism. They are sensitive to criticism of all types. They take it personally and often react with resentment and defensiveness. This is not an easy personality trait to subdue but, with practice, They can reprogram their thinking patterns, becoming less reactive and more open minded over time. As a starting point, They should attempt to convince themselves that all the criticism they receive is meant to be constructive—which it might very well be. If they can reach this point, their personal growth is all but ensured."
ESFP,"Investigate alternative learning strategies. They often have a hard time functioning in formal academic environments, where it is impossible to escape from the abstract and the theoretical. They prefer practical, hands-on learning that will help them develop specific skills that can be applied in real-world situations. Fortunately, there are alternative learning environments that can provide an XXXX-friendly learning experience—internships, apprenticeships, trade schools or technical colleges, individualized study programs at online universities. They could benefit tremendously if they ventured away from the traditional educational model and forged their own path."
ESFP,"Shine a flashlight into the darkest corners. They are notorious for avoiding unpleasant topics or situations. But running from trouble actually empowers it, allowing it to ruin relationships if tensions are left unaddressed. Instead of avoiding things that make them uncomfortable, They would be better off to confront them, before they have the chance to do any real damage. A positive attitude should not be used as an excuse for denial, which is always a bad idea no matter the circumstances."
ESFP,"At work, the XXXX wants to be hands-on and in the middle of the action. They prefer an active, social work environment where they are free to be spontaneous and have fun, with co-workers who are friendly, laid-back, and enthusiastic."
ESFP,"They are pragmatic, realistic, and tuned into the needs of others. They often choose a job that allows them to be of service to people, and where they can see real, tangible results for their efforts. They are talented at solving practical, people-centered problems, and can put this skill to good use in assisting others."
ESFP,"They are keenly tuned into their senses and often have an artistic streak. They may choose careers that engage their sensual nature through food, textiles, art, or music. They often want a career that allows them to move around, and generally prefer a work environment that is aesthetically pleasing."
ESFP,"They are stressed by strict rules or excessive bureaucracy at work, and want the flexibility to address situations as they arise. They generally focus on the demands of the present moment, and do not usually like to work on long-term projects, preferring work that has immediate and tangible results."
ESFP,"They are fun-loving team members who bring a sense of humor to the process. They simply love socializing with people, and typically see teamwork as a chance to interact and engage in a lighthearted way. They may not seem particularly driven or task-oriented to their teammates, but they keep an eye out for the needs of others, and offer assistance and support in a practical, down-to-earth way."
ESFP,"They are at their best when they can work on immediate, practical problems, without having to be too serious about the task at hand. They are good at facilitating cooperation, and often have a talent for listening to all points of view on a team with an open mind. They often see the talents that others can contribute to a team, and with their engaging enthusiasm, can get other people motivated to contribute. They may be less effective on teams which are competitive rather than cooperative. They may experience friction with teammates that insist on being very task-focused and don’t leave room for fun. They tend to lose interest in abstract discussions, and may have trouble with teams who spend a lot of time theorizing and little time taking action."
ESFP,"In leadership positions, They are realistic, encouraging, and enthusiastic. Their strength lies in their ability to energize and motivate a team to address immediate goals and crises.

When focused on a mission, They possess a Sherlock Holmes-like disposition to solving practical problems, built on an in-depth understanding of concrete facts."
ISFJ,"Hardworking. Intense and serious when a task needs to be completed, They are super-competent go getters who bring a hard-nosed approach to their work that can sometimes seem excessive to others. But it’s important to remember that They care deeply about people. When an XXXX puts her game face on it is a sign that she believes what she is doing will improve people’s lives and is worth taking seriously."
ISFJ,"Supportive. They are the consummate helpers; happy to share their time and energy with anyone who needs it and taking an empathetic approach to problems and goals. As parents, partners, friends, students, workers, entrepreneurs, neighbors, community members, public servants and citizens, They always strive for excellence, and it is the inclusivity and comprehensiveness of their vision that forms their identity and gives them their unique ability to brighten every corner of the worlds they inhabit."
ISFJ,"True to their word. By now we are all familiar with the values that XXXX hold dear: honor, integrity, responsibility, loyalty and commitment. This is all well and good, but to They it is far more important to walk the walk than talk the talk, and this is where They shine like the brightest stars. In business and personal relations, They are straight shooters who say what they mean and mean what they say. Their word is as good as gold."
ISFJ,"Resistant to change. They regard custom and tradition with the utmost respect and can become anxious with a world they see changing too fast and people who refuse to follow established standards. They in full 'tut-tut/tsk-tsk' mode may convince themselves that moral decay and a loss of respect for personal responsibility are destroying our society from the inside out, and they can become so immersed in pessimism that they will start seeing signs of degeneration and devolution everywhere they look. Diversity of thought and opinion are truly the spices of life, but They can become so enamored with orthodoxy that they forget this essential fact of existence."
ISFJ,"Too altruistic. Loyalty is an admirable character trait to be sure; but it is a two-way street, and if the people we choose to trust prove to be dishonest or unreliable we must be prepared to walk away. Yet They struggle with letting go, and have a tendency to stay in it to the bitter end, convinced that this is the only honorable thing to do."
ISFJ,"Take things personally. They are very private people, bordering on the shy, and this does not always mesh well with more open, unpredictable personality types. The social complexity of the environments they inhabit can overwhelm They and leave them feeling like square pegs in a universe of round holes. They have trouble dealing with conflict and a tendency to take even minor criticism personally. Combined with their stubborn streak, this can leave They feeling vulnerable and put upon, and they may resort to judgmental criticism themselves as a defense mechanism."
ISFJ,"Overload themselves. They are known for their terrific work ethic, but over time this positive trait can transmute into workaholism and leave an XXXX so overloaded that she loses sight of everything else. Workaholic They can be driven to distraction by their perfectionist tendencies, and even on those rare occasions when they manage to tear themselves away from the office and return home for a while, they will continue to obsess over their latest project or assignment, leaving them too distracted and preoccupied to enjoy their free time."
ISFJ,"Seek out contact with alien life forms. They have a tendency to ensnare themselves in their own worldviews and spend far too much time living inside their own heads. As such, they desperately need social contact with people who have different mindsets and ideological inclinations; this type of constructive social interaction can help They become more comfortable with diversity and accepting of social change, and it can prevent them from developing that stern schoolmaster’s countenance that others find so reactionary and off- putting."
ISFJ,"Speak even when you haven’t been spoken to. In their dealings with other people They sometimes operate as if their life's purpose is to keep the peace and make everyone happy—everyone except themselves, that is. This habit of suppressing emotions and deferring to the needs of others may seem noble, but in reality it can trap the XXXX in non-productive relationships that won’t make them happy. Speak up for yourself to reach your full potential as a human being."
ISFJ,"Step outside your comfort zone. This is good advice for everybody, but particularly for They who tend to get stuck in their routines to the point where they don’t have any time left over for fun and adventure. Take care to connect with your spontaneous, creative side, trying something new every now and then to ensure that your reverence for the tried-and-true does not calcify into rigidity."
ISFJ,"Lighten up! While the XXXX’s serious and sober attitude may be well-intentioned, a little humor and irreverence from time to time never hurt anyone—you don’t want to be the person who sucks the life out of a room. When they are on the job in particular, They should realize that fun, laughter and the occasional unplanned coffee break can help relieve stress and build camaraderie, which will only help to boost workplace efficiency in the long run."
ISFJ,"Don’t worry, be happy. Caution in the face of the unknown is the XXXX’s standard operating procedure, and it can be paralyzing—stopping personal growth in its tracks. It makes sense to worry in some instances but incessant worry is like a Death Star to happiness. Let go of the perfectionism every now and then and live a little. It’s only when you relax your strict standards that true happiness will come."

Sensitive and responsive, they step in to do what needs to be done and are satisfied by their personal sense of being helpful to others."

Best of all, the advice they give and the solutions they recommend are always practical, sensible and capable of making any situation better in the present moment."

ISFP,"Principled. They will not sacrifice their principles for anything, and they have little tolerance for cheaters, liars or hypocrites. Because they are so respectful and find conflict distasteful, They will not confront people who disappoint them, but they will disassociate themselves from those individuals as soon as they possibly can."
ISFP,"Individual. Some people spend their whole lives conforming to established standards and traditions. But They prefer to dance to the beat of their own drummers, relying on their own instincts to reveal what is right, good and true. They don’t do this as a way to gain attention, or stand out from the crowd. They simply believe that human nature is complex and varied and that everyone’s path should be unique."
ISFP,"Too sensitive. Kind and considerate They are so determined to keep the peace that they frequently suppress their unpleasant emotions or ignore their own needs. Putting people first is great, but They too often forget to include themselves among that privileged group. Unfortunately, They are very sensitive and can have their feelings hurt at the drop of a hat, so their habit of deferring to the interests of others to avoid conflict tends to put them in uncomfortable positions time after time."
ISFP,"Indecisive and unpredictable. They are innovative, flexible and adaptable. But there is a fine line between flexibility and indecisiveness, and sometimes They are so open-minded that they are unable to make firm and final decisions. Too often, They sway back and forth like willows in the wind, changing their minds repeatedly in response to every persuasive argument they hear."
ISFP,"Easily bored. They are doers who learn through direct experience and imitation. If the instruction they receive seems too abstract or theoretical, They view it with suspicion, believing this style of teaching to be boring or irrelevant. But this preference can adversely affect their performance as students. Effective learning requires focus and commitment, and They at times are not as dedicated as they should be. This can limit their ability to absorb new and useful knowledge."
ISFP,"Lack of future planning. They don’t always perceive the full consequences of their actions, or understand how the present inevitably shapes the future. Those who refuse to look beyond the immediate horizon may be unprepared for unpleasant happenings or overwhelmed by new duties and responsibilities—such as those that accompany the arrival of a child, for example. As a result, they may struggle with financial affairs, be ambushed by emergencies or fail to notice the way unresolved conflicts can poison relationships over the long term."
ISFP,"Choose honesty over harmony. They do what they can to preserve harmony and promote the peace.

This can cause strife in the short run, but in the long run it will help clear up misunderstandings and erase hurt feelings."
ISFP,"Develop a wider concept of what it means to be bold and adventurous. They tend to underestimate their own skills and intelligence.

There’s satisfaction to be gained from breaking free of these chains. The results may be unpredictable, but the uncertainty is what provides the challenge."
ISFP,"As Michael Jackson used to say, start with the man in the mirror. They have wonderful personal qualities. Their unselfishness and charitable attitude rank near the top of the list of their most attractive attributes. But They are so open-minded, respectful, considerate and polite that they tend to defer to others in virtually every circumstance. Too often, They treat others better than they treat themselves, acting as if their needs are somehow trivial or less important. So every now and then, They should make sure to include their own names on the list of the deserving—preferably somewhere near the top. Charity shouldn’t end at home, but there is no reason why it can’t begin there."
ISFP,"Network with dreamers, visionaries and futurists. They are a bit skeptical of those whose imaginations seem bigger than their accomplishments. In some cases this is justified, but in general They could benefit by seeking social contact with people who possess the long-term vision they sometimes lack. Reading autobiographies or downloading video interviews with such folks will also help They gain more insight into the thinking patterns and philosophies of successful entrepreneurs and inventors."
ISFP,"Actually make some plans for the future. It is possible for They to look ahead without abandoning their spontaneity and freedom. “What would I like to be doing five years from now?” “What does the phrase ‘personal growth’ mean to me?” “What would I like my life to look like when I turn 50?” These are the types of general, open-ended questions that can help They focus their creative energies without restricting their ability to make unique, spur-of-the-moment choices."

ISFP,"They are at their best when they can work with others in a supportive, action-oriented role. They excel at creatively solving problems to meet people’s immediate needs. They shy away from theory and future projections, and may become impatient with ideas that have no concrete benefit for people. They are characteristically unassuming, and may be reluctant to advocate strongly for their own perspective on a team. They can become frustrated with team members who are domineering or competitive, and do best on a caring, egalitarian team where everyone’s contribution is appreciated."

They are good at building trust and leading by example, preferring to be quietly supportive rather than authoritarian or domineering."

They often enjoy caring for children, but can sometimes become overworked and exhausted because of their natural impulse to help."

They enjoy creating order out of chaos and are always punctual. This contributes to the perception others have of them as reliable, dependable and steady."
ESTJ,"Dedication and commitment. No one could accuse the XXXX of shirking, and it’s natural for this type to give 110 percent in all areas of life and exhibit boundless energy as they do.

On the home front, They are committed to their families and desire to provide well for anyone they consider to be under their care."
ESTJ,"Judgmental. A black-and-white approach to life can be a significant pitfall for the XXXX.

They often have little patience for people who think or act intuitively or who react emotionally, seeing these as liabilities rather than potential strengths."
ESTJ,"Workaholism. While the XXXX work ethic is to be commended, people of this type can also err on the side of workaholism and perfectionism. Their Type A personality and intensity can be a little hard for others to take, as they are often quite unsympathetic to those who may not work as hard or as “perfectly” as they do."
ESTJ,"Stubborn and inflexible. They are committed to their own way or perspective as objectively right, and this can impede the process of personal growth. In fact, They are often so firmly planted in their original belief, as well as their own rightness, that they fail to acknowledge new or conflicting information that would lead to an altered and perhaps truer conclusion. Rigidity can keep them from being truly open minded and their practical approach to thinking and life in general may stifle their ability to think imaginatively or to exercise vision."
ESTJ,"Withhold judgment. They may be quite sure they have the motive, intent, outcome and conclusion figured out before they’ve received even a fraction of the details, and fail to acknowledge that he or she may not have the whole story. They will do well to hold off a bit before delivering a snap judgment or assessment. Focus on asking more questions, waiting for more details and acknowledging that as certain as you are, there may be things you are not seeing."
ESTJ,"Live and let live. They often don’t realize that their way isn’t the only way and that other personalities have much to contribute and should not be dismissed. The XXXX that can bend a little might find that flexibility and openness isn’t such a bad thing. There is really no need to be stubborn just for the sake of it."
ESTJ,"Be more self-critical. They have a tendency to think they are always right and that their moral compass is objective, absolute and universal. But their objectivity isn’t always objective as it appears—they have a standard that feels objective to them, often due to “how it’s always been done.” They would benefit from realizing that personal objectivity is, by definition, somewhat subjective, and spending some time examining the bases of their beliefs."
ESTJ,"Get in touch with their feelings. XXXX’s need to work on acknowledging their own feelings, and being a little more careful with the feelings of others. While it may seem that it’s “not personal,” it may be to a subordinate or a child. Harshness and rigidity can drive away good employees and estrange family members, so make a point to recognize the gifts and talents of others and to be intentional in showing appreciation for these talents."
ESTJ,"Take it easy. They need to work on stress relief and intentionally taking it easy. While they don’t want to be seen as lazy, it helps to remember that leisure and rest are not signs of sloth, but normal ways in which humans recharge. They benefit from taking vacations that really are vacations (not endless activity, planning and tourism) and to practice forced rest. Practices such as yoga, tai chi and meditation can help."

ESTJ,"They are very task focused and may become impatient with colleagues who want to discuss things for too long before deciding on action steps, especially if the discussion is overly abstract or theoretical. They will tend to try to take the lead in making a decision and moving on with a concrete plan of action.

ESTJ,"They tend to uphold the traditional way of doing things and may not recognize the need for innovation. They tend to trust their past experience, and may not be comfortable leading into an uncertain future. Vision can be a challenge for XXXX leaders, who are often better at implementing changes than conceiving of them."

The XXXX’s ultimate goal in parenting is to raise their children to be hardworking, productive, and observant of the rules and expectations of society."

ESTP,"They are often natural athletes; they easily navigate their physical environment and are typically highly coordinated. They like to use this physical aptitude in the pursuit of excitement and adventure, and they often enjoy putting their skills to the test in risky or even dangerous activities."
ESTP,"The XXXX's focus is action in the moment. They are engaged with their environments and solve practical problems quickly. They are excellent in emergencies, when they can apply their logical reasoning to situations where immediate action is necessary. Long-term goals are less interesting to the XXXX, who prefers to see tangible results in the moment."
ESTP,"The first thing you notice about the XXXX is likely to be their energy. They’re often chatting, joking, and flirting with friends and strangers alike. They enjoy engaging playfully with others and amusing everyone around them with their irreverent sense of humor. They tend to keep people on their toes, never quite knowing what the XXXX will poke fun at next. They are unabashedly gregarious with people, but their interest in individuals may not last long; they are more likely to work a room, having a laugh with everyone, than they are to engage in depth with any one person."
ESTP,"They are comfortable in their physical environment and always looking for some action or activity. They tend to be the most naturally coordinated of all the types and are often found playing sports or engaging in various physical activities, especially ones with an element of danger.

ESTP,"Popular hobbies for an XXXX include all sorts of sports and athletic pursuits, especially team sports and risky or adventurous activities like race car driving, boxing, or flying."
ESTP,"Can-do attitude. No one will ever call an XXXX lazy or uncertain, and this very self-assured, can-do approach to life and work is certainly a strength. People of this type spend more time acting than thinking, and while this may seem potentially unwise and hasty, they actually process information very rapidly and have a knack for improvising as they go. This makes them excellent in emergency situations as they think on the fly and respond reflexively."
ESTP,"Bold. They also abound in a mental toughness and sense of competition that make them relentless in pursuing what they are after. They respond well to their physical environment and know how to maneuver their world. They are efficient, clever, bold and driven. And as a result, they often get what they are after and aren’t afraid to take a few risks to get there."
ESTP,"Personable and sociable. They are people-focused and get along well with just about anyone. They are observant and perceptive, and they read people well. This has the benefit of helping others to feel that they are cared about because the XXXX pays attention and responds appropriately. Though They may not always pick up on or prioritize emotional cues, they are quick to notice and respond to tangible needs."
ESTP,"Direct. They are efficient, matter of fact, direct and to the point. They don’t mince words or want to spend a lot of time hemming and hawing. Many people appreciate their honesty and even their bluntness; you always know where you stand with an XXXX. They aren’t afraid to call it like they see it."
ESTP,"Judgmental. While They’ powers of perception and observation are often seen as strengths, it may also mean they are quick to prejudge situations and people, and to categorize them based upon initial perceptions. The downfall of this is that they potentially sacrifice many opportunities for profitable or enjoyable relationships or experiences simply on the basis of initial outward appearances."
ESTP,"Impatient. Because They are quick thinkers and doers, they easily become impatient with those who process at a slower pace than they do, who lack their capacity for common sense or street smarts or who tend to be more sensitive or emotional. They feel the emotional concerns of others to be an unnecessary drain on their energy and may resent them. They will also be reluctant to afford weight to intuition or feelings-based arguments."
ESTP,"Unstructured. People of this type tend to live in a state of urgency and emergency because they do very little advance planning. Though they may be comfortable with this pattern of living, it breeds chaos for everyone around them and can impede their professional and personal relationships. The crux of the issue is that They are often unstructured and undisciplined, exercising poor time management skills and taking on far more than they can handle; often because they have a hard time saying no or they refuse to admit they can’t fit it all in."
ESTP,"Commitment phobic. They hate to be bored and want life to always be new, stimulating and interesting. The reality, however, is that life is often not interesting or novel and relationships can get a little dull at certain points. They often lack the patience and the drive to stick it out through the low points."
ESTP,"Look inward. They will benefit from taking time for self-reflection and introspection, especially as they age. Throughout their lives they are prone to focus externally, always responding to their environments and the needs of the moment. The constant attention to things outside of themselves can distract them from healthy introspection, causing them to overlook important aspects of their own character and development and leave personal blind spots unaddressed."
ESTP,"Consider the consequences. They are natural risk takers, prone to pursue adventure and risky behaviors. Naturally, this invites the potential for disastrous consequences. Though They are quite confident in their abilities and usually accurate in these personal assessments, they will benefit from greater time spent considering the potential outcomes of their actions and decisions."
ESTP,"Think ahead. They live life so much in the present that they are often incapable of effectively planning for the future. Though they do enjoy flying by the seat of their pants, They will find they benefit from composing at least a loose plan or framework. It isn’t necessary to follow it exactly, but it can help ensure that they move in the direction of meeting their personal and professional goals. They may benefit from help with long-range future planning as well as developing time management skills."
ESTP,"Follow through. Constant living and responding in the moment can impede follow through and follow up. People of this type must endeavor to balance the acute with the chronic, the emergency situation or deadline with regular life. They should try to look at the whole project or problem and its future impact, not just the urgent piece. For the XXXX it is easy, and even comfortable, to jump from urgency to urgency, putting out fires one by one. But jobs need to be finished and wrapped up before hopping to the next task."
ESTP,"Check the rulebook. They naturally follow their own plans, systems and internal codes.

They will avoid unnecessary conflict and tension in the workplace if they can remember to get their plans approved before getting started."

They’re often great in a crisis, when their flexibility and action orientation makes them a clear head in the crowd. They may act as the voice of reason and will often point the group toward using available means to take immediate action."
ESTP,"They often want to keep interactions fun and casual on a team, and may have conflict with team members who are overly serious or insist that things be done a particular way. They prefer to keep things open-ended and flexible, and colleagues who want to lock into a plan may find resistance from the XXXX, especially if the XXXX does not see immediate, concrete benefits to the proposed action. They do best when they’re allowed to solve problems in their own practical, no-nonsense way, without a lot of imposed structure or rules."
ESTP,"They are eager to take charge, especially in a crisis situation. They are energetic and persuasive, and read others easily to adapt their approach and move the group toward their own point of view.

They tend to be attentive to their partners’ physical needs, but may neglect the deeper emotional connections. Serious discussions about feelings rarely hold much appeal for the thrillseeking INFJ,"

This trait is advantageous to them and can be that which sets them apart in their careers. Their peers and competitors may possess greater skills, but few will match the XXXX in dogged commitment."

To the institutions, organizations and people to which they are committed, they are unwavering in their service."

While They will be admired for their unwavering commitment to their duty and their sense of what is right and proper, the down side of this is that they can be stubborn, inflexible and dogmatic.

ISTJ,"Resistance to change. They, in their drive to uphold tradition and do things by the book, can be resistant to change and innovation. Suspicious of new advances and ways of doing things, not only do they experience strain when called upon to embrace change, they also often stifle creativity or fail to appreciate the benefit of approaching old problems in new ways. This can limit their potential and make them seem especially difficult and stodgy to their coworkers and subordinates."
ISTJ,"Question the procedure. Just because it’s “the way it has always been done” doesn’t mean it is the best or the only way. They find comfort in coasting along following the manner in which things have always been done. However, this can mean missed opportunities for growth and development, both personally and professionally. They will benefit by a willingness to break out of the rut of tradition. It certainly isn’t necessary to reinvent the wheel or fix what isn’t broken, but being willing to at least examine and question is essential."
ISTJ,"Question the rules. Their refusal to break the rules, while admirable in some respects, can be unwise. Not all rules are just or efficient, and guidelines aren’t all carved in stone.

ISTJ,"Be spontaneous. They have a strong internal sense of time management. While this is one of the mechanisms that enables them to work hard and meet deadlines, it can also be imprisoning.

ISTJ,"Get in touch with their feelings. They, in order to develop and become better-rounded individuals, may need to exert some effort in the emotions department. This will benefit them both in their personal and professional lives. Working to understand and express their own feelings will help to deepen and enliven their friendships and other primary relationships."
ISTJ,"Make time for leisure and personal development. They often become so laden with the duties of work, family and community that they devote little time to themselves. They, at the very least, need time to consider their lives and to think out the issues they face.

They do particularly well in physical endeavors of various types because they are able to insightfully size up their competition and position themselves properly in order to secure the victory. Flexible and adaptable, they improvise quickly in order to respond to the situation, trusting that their bodies and the instincts will guide them."
ISTP,"Insensitive. They tend toward blunt and unsweetened communication and in many ways this can be a strength because it means they are honest, direct and logical. But in excess, it becomes quite harsh and critical, especially if people don’t meet the XXXX’s standards of what constitutes logic, reason or practicality. Rather than accepting that people simply think differently, the XXXX can become irritated when made to deal with a way of thinking that is not natural for them."
ISTP,"Risk-seeking behavior. The XXXX’s restlessness, tendency to become bored and constant pursuit of the thrill can lead them to pursue risky and even reckless behaviors, not fully weighing the costs of their actions. While hedonism is a natural tendency of the They, some are particularly unwise in their quest for pleasure, thrills, the adrenaline rush and instant gratification, claiming “you only live once.” "
ISTP,"Impatient. They don’t deal well with the inability to move forward, make a decision or act in the moment. Waiting and deliberating is the much greater challenge. Their inability to be patient and their aversion to being bored can fuel their impulsiveness and hedonism in unhealthy ways as they seek their adrenaline fix."
ISTP,"Private and reserved. They have a strong need for personal space and solitude. In and of itself, this preference need not be classified as a weakness, though problems arise when this need dominates and causes them to push others away or avoid intimacy. They can be inordinately protective of their space, their solitude, their schedule and their way of doing things and, like a mama bear, can become quite defensive toward those who seek to move into this space without permission."
ISTP,"Make a plan. They are known for their tendency to avoid long-range planning, preferring to make decisions in the moment and live in the present. This means they often fail to take the steps that can help them to advance in their careers and other areas of life. While the XXXX doesn’t need to take their plan and etch it in stone, it helps to have a general framework in order to make decisions and take the steps that can better facilitate a successful career path. Work on setting goals, making commitments and long-range planning."
ISTP,"Balance opportunism. They inherently understand how to position themselves, and work skillfully with the resources and advantages they have in order to succeed. They can, as a result, be exploitative and opportunistic. The XXXX needs to be mindful of his or her goals and motives to make sure that “taking advantage” doesn’t involve taking advantage of someone else."
ISTP,"Learn time management skills. As Perceiving types, They prefer to let life come and determine the course of their day, rather than taking a proactive role in deciding how their time will be spent and what they will do. Effort spent on developing time management skills can help the XXXX gain better control of his or her time in order to actively prioritize and use this time rather than letting the needs of the day or the moment dictate. Better time management strategies can also help people of this type overcome their natural tendency to procrastinate."
ISTP,"Stop and reflect. They get easily caught up in the moment and engaged in the present situation, and once it’s over they’re on to the next. They spend their lives so externally focused that they often fail to set aside time for introspection, for reflection upon their actions and feelings or to learn from their mistakes. They develop as individuals when they will take a break in the action to spend a little time thinking about their lives, their feelings, where they are going, how they need to grow and what their next steps will be."
ISTP,"Reframe commitment. In life, love and work, They are generally hesitant to make commitments. They live in the day and focus their energies in the present. As a result, it is difficult for them to conceive of where they will be or what they will want to be doing at some point in the future. To become people who commit successfully, They can begin to think of their commitments as a daily renewal. One need not declare what ten years from now will look like, it’s only necessary to reframe commitment in terms of many small, daily commitments that over time build up to something resembling a long-term achievment."
ISTP,"At work, the XXXX is motivated by a desire to achieve and utilize technical expertise. They enjoy mastering and manipulating the tools of their trade, whatever they may be: the traditional hammers and saws, or the more modern tools of business or technology."
ISTP,"They prefer tasks with a tangible result, and typically feel most satisfied when they have built something concrete. They enjoy troubleshooting and often look for occupations that allow them to apply their skills to solve practical problems."
ISTP,"Many They enjoy occupations that involve physical activity, often with an aspect of risk or danger, and dislike being stuck at a desk. They are most often energized by action, and want to jump in to get things done rather than spend much time planning or theorizing."
ISTP,"They value efficiency and logic, and want flexibility in their work. They prefer a job where they can be practical and action-oriented without being overly burdened by rules, procedure, or bureaucracy."
ISTP,"They are practical, task-oriented team members who are usually more focused on the problem at hand than the people involved. They tend to look for ways to contribute with immediate action, and are talented, straightforward troubleshooters. They rarely demand attention from the team, preferring instead to observe and jump in where they see an opportunity to get something done."
ISTP,"They bring an efficient energy to a team and usually take it upon themselves to take practical action where they see the need. Their rational analysis often cuts straight to the heart of a matter and helps others see how to move forward. However, they don’t tend to have much patience for abstract discussion, and may neglect the niceties of working with others. In fact, many They prefer to just do what needs to be done, rather than having to spend time informing or including others."
ISTP,"In leadership positions, They tend to be flexible and hands-off, and expect their reports to be independent as well. They are practical and concrete in their approach, and will prefer to lead teams on projects where tangible results are seen quickly. Good in a crisis, They are energized by situations that must be acted on immediately, and will jump right in to get the job done."
ISTP,"They have a strong action orientation, and their understanding of tasks is often more kinetic than verbal. They often find it much easier to simply do something themselves than to explain it to someone else, which can create a challenge for XXXX leaders attempting to delegate. They often find it more natural to lead by example rather than explanation, and typically do best heading up teams of experienced, self-sufficient workers."
ISTP,"In relationships, the XXXX is independent and calm. They are often handy around the house, and enjoy being useful to their partners as quick and able problem-solvers."
ISTP,"They are fun-loving and adventurous, and will often encourage their partners to learn new and exciting physical skills. They are good at responding to their partners’ immediate physical needs, but may be less adept at dealing with emotions. They are natural troubleshooters, but look for logical, practical solutions to problems; more complex personal issues may leave them stumped."
ISTP,"Often private, the XXXX tends to keep their feelings and reactions to themselves. For the XXXX, this is not about withholding: they simply prefer to move on to the next activity rather than dwell on their emotional experience. They understand the temporary nature of their emotions, and rarely find them an interesting topic of conversation."
ISTP,"They are unlikely to offer flowery speeches or romantic overtures, and are more likely to show affection by being of practical service to their partners. They want their partners to appreciate their skills in getting things done, and to allow them plenty of freedom to do their own thing."
ISTP,"As parents, They often connect with their children through their mechanical and physical skills, first by teaching their children, and then by enjoying an activity together. They are rarely demonstrative or particularly verbal, and may show their love to their families by crafting or building something for them rather than being outwardly affectionate. They are generous and helpful but sometimes unreliable, and may become distracted from family responsibilities when adventure is at hand."
ISTP,"They are often reserved communicators, preferring action to conversation. They like to do what needs to be done and may grow impatient with discussion that does not turn quickly to action. They are often observant, picking up on details of the current situation, and evaluate information in a detached and logical way. Typically flexible and tolerant, the XXXX is ready to adapt to the situation at hand, but can be bluntly critical if they see inefficiency or incompetence."

INTJ,"They tend to be solitary and self-sufficient, so establishing friendships can sometimes be difficult. Because people with this personality type tend to think so much of the future, they may avoid getting to know people because they believe that a long-term friendship will not work out. The good news is that while They may not have a lot of friends, they do become very close and committed to those who persist. They tend to prefer friends who are also introverted, rational, and low on emotional drama.6﻿ "

INTP,"They tend to live inside their minds, so they can be quite difficult to get to know. Even in romance, they often hold back until they feel that the other person has proven themselves worthy of hearing these innermost thoughts and feelings. One thing to remember is that while They do enjoy romance in the context of a deeply committed relationship, they do not play games. Be honest and forthright.

In many cases, simply being willing to listen to whatever they have to share can be very helpful."

ESTP,"They are action oriented, results focused people who want to dive right into projects and get to the finish line via the most direct route. But the process shouldn’t be a chore! They are gifted with the ability to make just about any activity fun and playful, and they are at their best when they are focused on practical, realistic goals that can be achieved in a relaxed group effort (although some competition is usually good for an extra boost). They live life in a straightforward and open way, and have a good time while getting the job done."
ESTP,"When they are paying attention, virtually NOTHING escapes the eye of the XXXX. From little changes in appearance, to changes in rooms, to numbers in a spreadsheet, it’s like the most important or out of place detail just “jumps” out at them. And They have remarkable memories for recalling these things after the fact, even conversations involving lots of details, facts/figures, and step-by-step procedures (although they may get bored and stop listening after a while!)."
ESTP,"Theories about life and idle discussions about stuff that might happen at some point in the distant future are not that interesting for They. They prefer to stay in the moment, focusing on things that are real and happening around the. They approach problems and situations with a grounded and practical focus, looking for the most direct solution, and not getting too distracted about the reasons for the issue. Often, their ideas/solutions are the most direct, simple, and clear way to solve what is going on – and the XXXX is more than happy to fix it themselves."
ESTP,"They tend to like the excitement that goes along with risk. This doesn’t mean they all like sky-diving or swimming with sharks, but they do find a way to bring adventure and risk into their lives. Sometimes it’s by waiting until the last second to start a project, others times it involves pushing their humor to the edge, and seeing what they can get away with. Situations where other types would be freaking out do not affect the XXXX as dramatically. And, because they are so great under pressure, in crisis, and at the last minute, they rarely miss a step - despite the risk."
ESTP,"They want to cut to the chase and get things done, which means they’re not afraid to step into leadership roles, take command of situations . and tell other people what to do. They are logical people who can quickly weigh pros and cons about the current situation, and make tough choices. Often they have to learn to slow things down a bit, and remember to factor in the people piece of the analysis more."
ESTP,"They usually have an easy time talking with people they’ve just met, and are one of the most curious types. They are energized by lots of activity and people. Environments that might over-stimulate other types are usually fun and energizing for They.

ESTJ,"Outspoken. Proactive. Tenacious. Fast. Straightforward. Logic-driven. Decisive. Take Charge. High Energy. Dependable"
ESTJ,"They are one of THE most high energy, talkative types, and perhaps no type can top an XXXX when it comes to speed. Whether it is walking, talking, executing, deciding – you name it – they are the fastest. They typically accomplish more by lunchtime then most people accomplish in a day, and can become addicted to being “productive” and checking things off their personal or work “to do” list every minute, if they aren’t careful. They are highly outgoing and open to sharing about their lives, and are much more likely than their XXXX colleagues to “think out loud” and leave few relevant thoughts unspoken."
ESTJ,"They strongly desire closure on most things faster than almost anyone. They are energized by the part of the process when the vision is created, ideas generated and it is time to focus on execution! They are one of the hardest working types, wasting much less time than most making small talk, daydreaming, surfing the internet or taking many breaks in general."
ESTJ,"Often able to quote back what others have said in conversations days prior, They give and can absorb a lot of detailed, factual information upon which they tend to base decisions. Unlike the intuitive types, They do not enjoy extended brainstorming sessions or receiving a “blank page” of a project where they need to create the vision from scratch. They prefer having as much information as possible when beginning a project, and excel at taking an existing process and tweaking it to achieve maximum efficiency."
ESTJ,"They are “off the charts” logic driven - instantly able to see what decision makes the most sense objectively, given the facts. They are perhaps the type least likely to make a decision that doesn’t make logical sense on paper. They tend to be thick skinned when it comes to feedback or disagreements, and are great at both giving and receiving very specific direction and instruction. As one of the most transparent types, They are mostly “what you see is what you get.” This can mean that at times they are quite direct (to the point of being blunt) in an effort to get things done. They tend not to sugar-coat their feedback or reactions as much as others in order to avoid detracting from the clarity of message."
ESTJ,"They leave nothing to chance. As THE most proactive of the 16 types, they don’t wait for it to all “work out”. they MAKE it all work out! Typically the most effective way to complete a task is very clear to them. Since they have a strong sense of responsibility and desire to be in control, they have to be careful not to over-manage and under-delegate when working with direct reports. When there is a clear objective, They often take charge very confidently, even in groups of people they don’t know well."
ESTJ,"Take action immediately. Be seen as proactive and be relied upon to get it DONE. See the most logical decision the fastest. Take charge in a group of people without a leader. Instruct others HOW to do a task, step-by-step. Repeat themselves for clarity. Do everything quickly (eat, fall asleep, decide, walk, talk, execute). Express their opinion early and often. Be known for “What you see is what you get!” Become visibly stressed by extreme time pressure"
ESFP,"Fun. Free-Spirited. Easy-Going. Entertaining. Talkative. Sensitive. Casual. Sympathetic. Kinesthetic. In the Moment"
ESFP,"Spontaneous, casual and comfortable with “winging it,” They often do their best work last minute when the pressure of the deadline is right upon them. Calm, cool and collected (at least on the outside) in a crisis, they are able to leap into action and troubleshoot swiftly and efficiently while others get frazzled. With a free spirited, “live and let live” attitude, They are the least likely type to judge others or try to offer unsolicited direction or advice. They tend to be collaborative leaders, with very little impulse to take control or credit. It is not uncommon for them to put off decisions that are difficult, live “moment-to-moment” and take a more “let’s see how things play out” approach than most. They tend to work in bursts of inspiration, with a lot of breaks throughout the day."
ESFP,"Keenly observant of their physical surroundings, nothing gets past an XXXX. They find it easier than most to live completely “in the moment” most of the time. As a result, They have excellent sensory awareness and don’t miss a single thing happening around them. They also have great recall of facts and can relay conversations (the who said what) with great detail."
ESFP,"They have a low interest in theory, analysis, or “big picture” abstract discussions, preferring to focus on things that are tangible and happening around them in “real time.” They are usually kinesthetic, “hands on” learners, who much prefer to learn by physically “doing” rather than reading or listening. They tend to put off thinking about the distant future or doing long term strategic planning in favor of focusing on the present moment or the very short term future."
ESFP,"Staggeringly perceptive, They are one of the types MOST highly attuned to the emotional reactions of others (and their own feelings as well). Highly averse to conflict or tension, They go well out of their way to maintain harmonious relationships and avoid confrontation. As one of the more humble, sensitive types, They take criticism very seriously (and often to heart), tending to withdraw, not engage. Unlike their XXXX colleagues (who are logic driven), They are uncomfortable making decisions based predominantly on impersonal, logical analysis. They care deeply about people and see something positive in everyone. Kind, generous, caring and exceptionally cautious not to offend others, They take great pleasure in contributing to the well being and happiness of others in tangible ways."
ESFP,"Energized by talking, environments that might over-stimulate other types are usually quite attractive and exciting to They, who report being happiest when they are active and social. They are one of the types that needs and spends the least amount of time inside their own head, reflecting and processing. Almost all of their focus is on what is happening in the moment, around them, and an XXXX thinks best while talking. They typically have an easy time developing instant rapport with others, and can bring lightheartedness and fun to almost any group or environment."
ESFP,"Reach celebrity status in jobs that require multi-tasking concrete tasks while talking - such as a DJ, cooking show host, musician, stylist, or actor. Say what others want to hear to avoid hurting their feelings. Be naturally happy and highly value happiness (their own and others'). Remember the face and name of virtually everyone they have met. Recognize an acquaintance out of context or in a crowded place. Be instantly likeable. Want to be ever-present in their children’s lives. Give off a non-judgmental, non-bossy vibe. Quit a job due to micro-management. Dislike standardized tests."
ESFJ,"Warm. Responsible. Attentive. Talkative. Enthusiastic. Sensitive. Affectionate. Sympathetic. Outgoing. Generous"
ESFJ,"Warm, high energy, talkative, friendly and highly emotionally intelligent, They are the quintessential “people” people, and tend to develop instant rapport with and bring out the best in virtually everyone. Energized most by a highly social environment, They tend to require very little alone time. They are perhaps the easiest type to get to know, usually sharing lots of detailed information about themselves early in conversations, and drawing the same out of others. Often feeling things more deeply than others, they have immediate emotional reactions that show up on their very expressive faces. They may have to force themselves to wait before responding when they feel emotionally charged. They are also the type most gifted at “reading” the emotional state and style of others – and adapting their style to be most pleasing to whomever they are with at the moment, being exceptionally diplomatic and cautious to avoid unnecessarily offending anyone."
ESFJ,"They value closure, tradition, and stability. They tend to ask a lot of specific, concrete questions of others in an effort to reach full clarity (and to make sure that everyone’s needs and desires are being met). This allows them to fulfill their driving need to have closure, to constantly be productive, and ensure that all their “ducks are in a row.” They are often the enthusiastic “cruise director” in their circle of friends/family: organizing traditions, celebrations, vacations, gifts, and the like. They tend to put others’ needs before their own, and often struggle to say “no” when asked for a favor - even if they are maxed out. They also tend to have a deep sense of duty and responsibility, and work hard to ensure that others feel well cared for by them. They like to feel that others view them as highly reliable and dependable."
ESFJ,"They leave people feeling good about themselves and appreciated. They take great pleasure in contributing to others’ happiness by helping in concrete ways. Their strong desire to be well-liked, to be seen as nice, generous, and helpful, makes them highly supportive and generous with their energy and time. While no one can top an XXXX in the level of attention, compliments, gifts and favors that they shower on those they love, They do tend to thrive on heavy and regular doses of positive affirmation in return, showing them that they are appreciated and liked as a person."
ESFJ,"There are two phases of most projects or meetings: 1) the vision/strategy setting stage and 2) the execution stage. They often prefer the latter more concrete stage, where the vision is created, ideas generated, and time is focused on execution! If the coordinates are set and it is clear what action items need to take place, They are focused and driven to complete them as quickly as possible. Often, their skills are best used when the project requires taking an existing process, understanding all the detailed pieces of it, and then tweaking it for efficiency - versus starting with a more “blank page” type of project (the preference of their XXXX colleagues)."
ESFJ,"They are detail people. They remember most details - such as what someone was wearing at an event, or specific names and dates. They have an especially great memory for details shared during conversations, and can often relay who said what, how it was phrased, and the order and flow of the conversation (not perfectly, of course)."
ENTP,"Creative. Funny. Adaptable. Unconventional. Futuristic. Clever. Tenacious. Strategic. Independent. Skeptical"
ENTP,"They pride themselves on being independent, skeptical, intellectually-disciplined thinkers who see a lot of nuance to life (one of the reasons why they often initially resist the theory of personality types). They tend to think of exceptions when others make general statements, and their minds easily switch to opposing perspectives as a way to understand the logic behind someone else’s position or argument. They typically enjoy playfully debating and challenging others to reconsider their thinking on a wide variety of topics."
ENTP,"They have a rare creative spark that allows them to generate a stream of new ideas on any number of topics. This is mostly likely to occur in discussions with other people. An XXXX’s ideas often relate to how systems, processes, and the world can be improved. In thinking of these ideas, the XXXX is not restricted at all by conventional wisdom. In fact, They would rather try out new approaches to find a better way than rely on how it has been done (even if successfully) in the past."
ENTP,"Creating pictures of possible futures is a relatively easy process for They, compared to the other types. They tend to be strongly visual and “seeing” how things might look in the future just taps into their imagination - and off they go. In many ways, They are driven by finding out what is possible – to see what potential a thing, a process, an idea, a company, and even what they themselves are truly capable of. They often carefully chose their areas of interest based on the potential it has, and also whether they themselves have potential to succeed."
ENTP,"They work in bursts of inspiration, not by carefully structuring or planning out their process. Often their best work occurs in a flurry right before a deadline. They also tend to remain extremely calm in very stressful situations (relative to other types). This is partly due to their tendency to frame the situation in terms of the big picture, and not get caught up in a momentary loss of perspective. They often thrive in roles where handling pressure and the unexpected is required daily, and find roles with too much structure and certainty to be less engaging."
ENTP,"They are known for their insightful, thoughtful and unique perspectives. Their best ideas or solutions to complex problems usually come after they’ve mulled the topic over for awhile. This “percolating” process can take a couple of days, is not always conscious, and more often than not leads to a solution that just “pops” into their heads."
ENTP,"They have an easier time than most types determining where someone else is coming from, and flexing their style to get their message across. They tend to “finesse” conversations unconsciously, using humor, charm, and a playful debating style to get their message across both clearly and persuasively. Deep down, They are people-pleasers and like to make others think highly of them - so they convince others to see their perspective and leave everyone smiling."
ENTP,"Initially reject the notion of personality types. Come up with a million ideas (finishing them is another story). Convince other jury members to agree with them. Delegate most of their work to other people (if they can!). Annoy friends and family with “playing devil’s advocate” and debating. Bring tremendous energy, vision and focus at the start of a project. Lead a team through a strategy session. Seek mastery in one or two areas, eventually be one of the very best. Start a company based on their own idea. Grow a company too fast and go bankrupt"
ENTJ,"Take Charge. Bold. High-Energy. Strategic. Proactive. Confident. Assertive. Innovative. Decisive. Tenacious"
ENTJ,"Enthusiastic, direct and charismatic, They are one of the most high energy, talkative types. They are typically very comfortable sharing about their lives and are much more likely than their XXXX colleagues to “think out loud.” Highly articulate, They have a naturally bold and dynamic presence that tends to command the attention of the room. Often their tremendous outward self confidence and excellent verbal skills draw others to them, but can at times overpower or intimidate certain personality types. They are the type that have to work the hardest to not interrupt others (usually in an effort to fight for “the floor” or avoid hearing excessive details)."
ENTJ,"They have a strong need to be constantly learning and challenging themselves. They thrive when they are continuously working towards higher levels of competency, and are easily bored by assignments or tasks that they have mastered. Intellectually curious, They learn by challenging others’ positions, expecting them to defend their positions for the benefit of better understanding both sides. They tend to respect others who can argue their position."
ENTJ,"There are two phases of most projects or meetings: (1) the vision and strategy-setting stage and (2) the execution stage. Unlike their XXXX colleagues, They tend to gravitate towards the former. Highly future focused, out-of-the-box, logic-driven thinkers, few can match the XXXX’s capacity when it comes to doing what they love - developing long-term strategies or solving complex problems that involve a lot of moving pieces. They’ minds are unconventional and unrestricted by previous approaches or traditional thinking."
ENTJ,"They are driven more by logic than personal values. They don’t necessarily check in with their own emotions when making decisions, and can at times overlook others’ emotional reactions. Strategic visionaries, They excel at objectively analyzing and planning for the long-term needs of an organization. Much less sensitive than their XXXX colleagues, They usually would rather be “right” than be “liked,” and can be very direct (to the point of being blunt). They tend not to “sugar coat” their feedback or reactions as much as other types, in order to not detract from the clarity of message."
ENTJ,"They drive for closure quickly and are some of the very fastest decision makers on the planet. “Good enough” is not typically part of the vocabulary of an XXXX. They have extremely high standards for themselves, as well as a tremendous stamina for hard work. They tend to hold others to the same high standards and work ethic that they expect from themselves. As one of the most proactive of the 16 types, they don’t wait for it to all “work out”…they MAKE it all work out! They constantly push themselves to achieve excellence in all of their endeavors, which often translates into long hourswith more focus and fewer breaks in concentration than most other personality types. Natural born leaders, They have no problem taking charge in a group of people without a leader, even among new people or environments."
ENTJ,"Fight for the floor. Be a workaholic. Be seen as assertive, bold and/or confident. Have LOTS of energy. Move up the corporate ladder quickly. Make big decisions quickly. Finish others’ sentences. Become impatient with a lot of detail. Be a natural-born leader. Intimidate or overpower others"
ENFP,"Sensitive. Visionary. Casual. Idealistic. Energetic. Spontaneous. Imaginative. Insightful. Gregarious. Collaborative"
ENFP,"They are “idea generators” much more than they are “detail people.” Often ingenious designers of “win-win” solutions that have a long term positive impact on people, They are a continuous source of “out of the box” ideas. Exceptionally optimistic, They more than any other type believe that everything is possible. There are two phases of most projects or meetings: 1) the initial “big picture,” “vision setting” stage; and 2) the logistics or “action items” stage. Innovative visionaries, They shine during the former, gaining much more energy from envisioning future possibilities and idea generating then from completing concrete tasks. They tend to lose steam toward the end of projects when everything is decided and only the final execution steps remain, particularly when this involves handling details. They report that remembering random specifics is not a natural gift. As a result, they tend to rely heavily on copious note-taking for things like “action items” and logistics."
ENFP,"Insightful, humorous, and highly energetic with “the gift of the gab,” They as a group tend to develop rapport with others faster than any other type. They intuitively “get” what makes others tick, and then swiftly and naturally adapt their approach accordingly. Their exceptional social skills, genuine warmth, passion, and infectious enthusiasm draw others to them. They spend a great deal of time connecting on a “personal level” in their work relationships, and maintaining a large professional network. They are “people” people who become drained by long stretches of time working alone. They need the stimulation of a collaborative environment to feel energized and to be able to “fire on all cylinders.” They think best out loud, and generate ideas most easily in group brainstorming sessions."
ENFP,"Staggeringly perceptive, They are one of the types MOST highly attuned to the emotional reactions of others (and their own feelings as well). Their insights into the emotions at play and motivations behind behavior are usually amazingly accurate. They naturally put others needs before their own, and often go well out of their way to maintain harmony in their relationships. They develop thicker skins over the course of their career, but generally they tend to take criticism personally, and may read more into feedback than was intended."
ENFP,"Generous and empathetic, They have a special gift for leaving others feeling inspired and valued for their unique gifts. They naturally provide energetic support, appreciation, and positive feedback to others. As people who “aim to please,” They feel a surge in motivation when they themselves also receive regular and genuine compliments. They love to inspire others to gain a new perspective and reach their maximum potential. As the MOST idealistic type, they would rather err more on the side of giving others the benefit of the doubt, and thus usually meet others well more than half way."
ENFP,"Flexible, casual, spontaneous, and easy going, They love surprises and tend to leave their options open as long as possible. They might struggle a bit to stay organized, and they can be easily distracted from the task at hand."
ENFP,"Develop instant rapport with a stranger. Find that others readily share personal information with them. Decide by involving others; value consensus. Be seen as optimistic, idealistic and emotionally intelligent. Follow their “gut” or hunches without concrete facts. Build consensus. Create a collaborative, team environment. Be able to adapt their style to each situation or person. See life as a fun adventure with endless possibilities. Be a celebrity musician, talk show host, or theater actor"
ENFJ,"Affectionate. Sensitive. Creative. Talkative. Charismatic. Visionary. Empathetic. Idealistic. Planful. Values-Driven"
ENFJ,"Empathetic, high energy, charismatic, and humorous, They are “people” people who tend to develop instant rapport with others. They are usually comfortable sharing personal information about themselves early in a relationship, and often drawing the same out of others. Their exceptional social skills, genuine warmth, passion, and high positive energy attract others to them. They spend a great deal of time connecting on a “personal level” in their work relationships and maintaining a large professional network, and become drained by long stretches of time working alone."
ENFJ,"They are much more “idea generators” than they are “detail people,” and they love to discover “win-win” solutions that have a long-term positive impact on people. There are two phases of most projects or meetings: 1) the initial “big picture,” “vision setting” stage; and 2) the logistics or “action items” stage. They often shine during the former, and gain much more energy from creating, rather then from executing. They typically enjoy those “blank page” assignments with maximum creative license to design the vision from scratch and find an original, “out-of-the-box” approach to a complex problem."
ENFJ,"Highly emotionally intelligent, They are great at “reading” the emotional state of others, and excel at delivering difficult messages with compassion and diplomacy. They thrive in collaborative environments, and have a gift for persuasion and building consensus. They are happiest when they are inspiring others, helping them gain a new perspective and reach their maximum potential in life. Naturally empathetic and sensitive, They tend to “wear their hearts on their sleeves,” and often feel things more deeply than others. They sometimes have immediate emotional reactions that are often visible, and they are quick to address others’ emotions."
ENFJ,"“Good enough” is not typically part of the vocabulary for an XXXX. Blessed with tremendous focus, will power, and perseverance, They constantly push themselves to reach any goal they have set out to achieve. Not big fans of “winging it” or surprises, They find lack of closure to be anxiety producing. As a result, they typically prefer to plan way ahead, and over prepare whenever possible."
ENFJ,"They have minds built to immediately connect concepts and ideas, as well as people. They easily remember immense amounts of information about each person in their often large network, and have a knack for connecting people who have shared interests. Gracious and warm, They are also the type most naturally gifted at hosting parties, and have a way of making others feel like the most important person in the room."
ENFJ,"They quickly see the positive potential in other people and constantly seek to inspire others to reach their maximum potential. Colleagues feel encouraged to aim big, and just being around an XXXX can provide them with the boost of confidence needed to accomplish their goals. Careers advance and projects get done – all much faster due to the presence and efforts of the XXXX."
ENFJ,"Heavily weigh their first impression of someone. Feel strongly about people quickly (positively or negatively). Be seen as both highly empathetic and highly self confident. Be a great networker who enjoys making connections for others. Constantly seek to improve themselves in every way (perfectionist). Inspire and gain support from large numbers of people very quickly. Be seen as highly diplomatic, eloquent, an excellent public speaker. Confidently follow their hunches especially about people. Be seen as any of these: charismatic, gracious, generous, articulate. Make a fantastic first impression"
ISTP,"Concise. 'In the moment'. Spontaneous. Down-to-earth. Logic-driven. Unflappable. Level-headed. Realistic. Private. Quiet"
ISTP,"James Bond is surely an XXXX! Stoic, quiet, great under pressure, and logic-driven, They would much rather just DO it, then TALK about it. In fact, they speak the fewest words on average of any type. Unlikely to interrupt others or fight for the floor, They often think best when alone. They typically prefer to gather information, come to a conclusion, and then (sometimes) share their thoughts. Often seen as mysterious, They are the type most likely to surprise others with their actions and decisions, because they don’t naturally keep others in the loop. However, when the situation calls for persuasion, They can turn on the charm and have a fun way about them that lets others to relax, smile and get on board."
ISTP,"They are extremely efficient in every sense of the word. They have a knack for avoiding any unnecessary steps, whether it’s executing a project or physically moving throughout their environment. They virtually never run in circles, chatter, “think out loud,” or use unnecessary energy. As leaders, they see the end goal quickly, and They are the best on the planet at cutting through bureaucratic procedures and red-tape. They expect their team to act quickly to resolve issues, and to bring them solutions (not problems). Highly practical, realistic, and action-oriented, They are more inclined to “just do it,” and become quickly bored with theory, long-term future predictions, or abstract discussions."
ISTP,"They are highly logic-driven, and tend to make decisions based on what makes the most logical sense from an objective viewpoint. They are not nearly as aware of – or as swayed by – how others or even how they themselves personally feel about a decision. They are one of the least sensitive or emotional of the 16 types, and are fantastic at avoiding any type of “drama.”"
ISTP,"Keenly observant of their physical surroundings, nothing gets past an XXXX. They find it easier than most to live completely “in the moment” most of the time, not as distracted or stressed as types who focus on the past or future. They are kinesthetic, “hands on” learners, who much prefer to learn by physically “doing,” rather than reading or listening. They are often drawn to professions that involve physically and actively performing under pressure. They are also disproportionately represented among top athletes, emergency or crisis response teams, and other active jobs."
ISTP,"They have a remarkable ability to avoid over-complicating things, and are often the first to identify the most direct solution to complex problems. This ability to find “elegant simplicity,” paired with their action- oriented approach, enables They to deliver impressive results with maximum speed and an almost ruthless efficiency."
ISTP,"Extremely even-keeled, They do not become rattled very easily. Part of their wiring – even as babies! – endows them with nerves of steel. This enables They to troubleshoot with a clear head, even in urgent or crisis situations. In fact, They often perform at their best under time pressure, and it is very common for them to do the bulk of their work at the very last possible minute, just before the deadline."
ISTP,"Not keep others in the loop; surprise people with their decisions. Say the fewest words per day (quietest of all 16 types). Do things at the last minute - most of the time. Live in the moment. NOT overanalyze. NOT take any unnecessary steps or do unnecessary work. Be a sensor (S) but often not remember specifics of conversations. Be seen as calm, cool and collected - especially in urgent situations. Have an objective and realistic view/perspective. Be concise emailers"
ISTJ,"Precise. Methodical. Literal. Clear. Meticulous. Responsible. Accurate. Realistic. Loyal. Reserved"
ISTJ,"There are two phases of most projects or meetings: 1) the vision/strategy setting stage, and 2) the execution stage. They tend to gravitate towards the latter. If the coordinates are set and it is clear what action items need to take place, no one is more focused and driven to complete them with precision than the XXXX. Often, their skills are best used when the project requires taking an existing process and tweaking it to reach maximum efficiency. This is in contrast to their XXXX colleagues, who are more energized by the “big picture,” open-ended, vision-setting stage."
ISTJ,"They can be quite talkative with their inner circle of close friends, family, and a handful of close colleagues. To others, They can come across as very reserved, private, and quietly reflective, with a calm exterior. They are not likely to interrupt others or fight for the floor, and often think best when alone, preferring to gather information, reflect on it, and then share their thoughts."
ISTJ,"They tend to value what has worked well in the past and find comfort in the “known,” making them one of two types that most desire structure, routine and planning ahead. Not big fans of surprises or “winging it,” They often get into a rhythm of waking, sleeping, working and exercising at predictable times most days. They usually have repeatable habits as well - such as purchasing a very similar list of items at the grocery store each week, or laying out their clothes the night before in preparation for their workday."
ISTJ,"They are some of the most dependable, organized, responsible, and meticulous people on the planet, and often live by the rule: “my word is my bond.” If an XXXX has made a commitment to do something (no matter how insignificant), they will do everything in their power to get it done - and on time. They are exceptionally playful and highly closure-focused, and when it comes to decisions, and they have a tendency to want to “get down to business” and “cut to the chase” quicker than most other types."
ISTJ,"They are highly logic-driven, and tend to make decisions based on what makes the most logical sense from an objective viewpoint. They are not nearly as aware or as swayed by how they themselves or others personally feel about a decision as their XXXX colleagues. They would rather be respected and thought of as fair than thought of as nice."
ISTJ,"They have remarkable memories for specifics (even those given verbally), and ability to follow (and provide) precise multi-step procedures to the absolute letter. This memory, combined with their very high attention span for details, which allows them to focus for extended periods of time, makes them one of the types that leaves the very least number of t’s un-crossed and i’s un-dotted. Nothing slips through the cracks on an XXXX’s watch."
ISTJ,"Enjoy a daily routine (when they wake, sleep, eat, or exercise). Be accurate in any facts or details you state. Get it done right the first time. Be financially conservative. Always have a back-up plan. Under-delegate. Keep an impeccably neat house, desk, or car. Strongly dislike surprises. Stay with the same company for many, many years. Be relied upon for institutional knowledge"
ISFP,"Kind. Private. Observant. Reserved. 'In the moment'. Quiet. Unassuming. Sensitive. Free-spirited. Spontaneous"
ISFP,"Reserved, intensely private, and unobtrusive, it can take many encounters to get to know the incredible warmth, generosity, kindness, playful humor, and often impressive skill set of an XXXX. First impressions do not do them justice; They are the type least likely to “advertise” their own strengths. They are one of the most sympathetic types who genuinely care about and enjoy people. However, being in highly social environments tends to drain their energy - they crave time inside their own head to process and recharge. As one of the least talkative types, They share a very small percentage of their opinions, concerns, or decision- making process. They tend to enjoy working behind the scenes in supportive roles that help people in concrete ways."
ISFP,"Blessed with the gift of an exceptional memory for facts, trivia, events, and conversations, They are able to remember specifics better than most. Highly practical, realistic, and action- oriented, They are much more inclined to “just do it” – rather then talk about it – and have a low interest in theory, analysis, future prediction or abstract discussions. They naturally excel at handling logistics or concrete tasks in the smoothest, most elegantly efficient way possible, with the least amount of complexity or wasted time."
ISFP,"Staggeringly perceptive, They are one of the types MOST highly attuned to the emotional reactions of others (and their own feelings, as well). Their insights into what others are feeling are usually amazingly accurate. Highly averse to conflict or tension, They focus a lot of energy on maintaining harmony and avoiding confrontation. As one of the more sensitive types, They take criticism very seriously (and often to heart), and tend to withdraw, not engage. Intensely private, they are the least likely type to share that they had a negative or hurt reaction, leaving others totally unaware of the damage done."
ISFP,"Spontaneous, casual, and comfortable with “winging it,” They often do their best work last minute with the pressure of the deadline upon them. Others find their easy going, relaxed style infectious. Calm, cool, and collected (at least on the outside) in a crisis, they are able to leap into action and efficiently troubleshoot when other types might be frantic. They are some of the most patient, flexible people, with a free-spirited, independent style. With a “live and let live” attitude, They are perhaps the least likely type to judge others, or try to offer unsolicited advice. They tend to be collaborative leaders, with very little impulse to take control or credit."
ISFP,"They have strong personal values, and while they do not discuss them much with others, they have a large impact on the XXXX’s actions and decisions. They seek to feel that they are living their lives in accordance with their values and what “feels” right to them. They care deeply about people, seeing something positive in everyone. They take great pleasure in tangibly contributing to the well-being and happiness of others."
ISFP,"Keenly observant of their physical surroundings while living fully in the moment, nothing gets past an XXXX. They have excellent sensory awareness, and trust most what they can see, smell, taste, touch and hear. They are kinesthetic, “hands on” learners, who much prefer to learn by physically “doing,” as opposed to reading or listening. They also tend to have a creative streak and a great sense of aesthetics."
ISFP,"Be sensitive to criticism. Tread lightly with others, particularly with sensitive topics. Be humble and modest, hardly ever 'self promote'. NOT insult or upset others. Avoid conflict, or even tension. Desire a job outdoors. Not gravitate toward a desk job in the corporate world. See the best in others. Dislike public speaking. Not express negative opinions"
ISFJ,"Precise. Sensitive. Literal. Sympathetic. Planful . Accommodating. Decisive. Private. Efficient. Reserved"
ISFJ,"Warm, patient, loyal, and exceptionally kind, They take great pleasure in helping others in concrete, practical ways, and tend to put other people’s needs before their own. In fact, the XXXX’s generous disposition, combined with their sense of duty and discomfort with conflict or confrontation, makes it very difficult for them to say “no.” As a result, it is common for others to over-rely on them. They are also one of the types MOST highly attuned to the emotional reactions of others (and their own feelings as well), and they focus a lot of energy on maintaining harmony. As one of the more sensitive types, They take criticism very seriously (and often to heart), and tend to withdraw, not engage. They do their very best every day to please others and exceed expectations, and they thrive on private positive feedback."
ISFJ,"They highly value security, traditions, rules and protocol. More than other types, they also tend to value what has worked well in the past and find comfort in “the known.” As a result, they are one of two types that MOST crave structure, routine, and planning ahead. Not big fans of surprises or “winging it,” They prefer to decide and gain closure on most things as early in the process as possible. They enjoy planning all of the details of their vacations or holiday celebrations well ahead of time, to ensure things go smoothly (unlike their more spontaneous XXXX colleagues). The sooner they can put something on their calendar, the better - and multiple contingency plans are a specialty of They."
ISFJ,"Chatty and enthusiastic with close friends, initially They can come across as reserved, private, and reflective with a calm exterior. Patient, attentive listeners, They are very unlikely to interrupt others or fight for the floor. They often think best when alone, preferring to gather information and reflect before sharing. While they enjoy people a great deal, they recharge their energy best and feel most themselves when they have significant time alone each day to focus and get “in the zone,” doing concrete productive tasks – such as time online, running, cooking, reading, or gardening."
ISFJ,"They are highly observant, precise and detail-oriented people, with the gift of the very BEST memory of any type. They are typically able to relay who said what, how it was phrased, and even the order and flow of the discussion (not perfectly of course, but better than most types). They often stun others with their vivid recollection of factual details, events and occasionally entire conversations from years ago. Those close to They learn never to question their facts! They are also highly realistic, down-to-earth, and matter-of-fact when it comes to handling logistics. Unlike their XXXX colleagues, who can sometimes overcomplicate logistics, They excel at executing in THE fastest, smoothest, most efficient way possible."
ISFJ,"They have remarkable memories for specifics, and are able to follow (and provide) precise multi-step procedures to the absolute letter. This strength for recall, combined with their very high attention span for details, makes them one of the types that leaves the very least number of t’s un-crossed and i’s un-dotted."
ISFJ,"Not take explicit credit for their hard work. Be extremely neat and organized. Have difficulty saying “no” when asked for a favor. Be seen as any of the following: nurturing, loyal, selfless, helpful. Believe in the best in those they love, and meet them more than halfway. Remember events, facts, and conversations from years past - in great detail. Value stability, security and loyalty. Think twice before stepping outside their comfort zone. Quietly take on all of the details that others neglect. Exhaust themselves by constantly doing for others without a break"
INTP,"Private. Logic-Driven. Analytical. Original. Unconventional. Skeptical. Disorganized. Independent. Internally-Motivated. Witty"
INTP,"Quiet, curious, and deep, They tend to spend a great deal of their day inside their own heads. They have one of the more highly developed “inner worlds” of any of the types and this is where they do their best thinking. Often they are SO deeply in their own head, that they miss things going on around them in the immediate external world. If a subject or problem has piqued their interest, They will devote countless hours to understanding the topic fully, and achieve remarkable expertise (even at a very young age). Once they have mastered a skill or subject area, they often move on to the next area of interest, preferring to keep their learning curve at the maximum slope possible, a few topics at a time."
INTP,"They are the world’s “big picture” problem solvers, especially problems that involve systems. They thrive most when they are working independently for long stretches of time to develop a solution to a problem that is too complex and intellectually challenging for others to solve. Their specialty is designing cutting edge systems that solve a current problem, but also handle unforeseen future challenges. Characteristically independent, original thinkers, with unconventional thought patterns, They analyze problems very differently than other types and therefore are often the creative genius behind breakthroughs in systems. For example, Albert Einstein, Charles Darwin, Bill Gates, George Lucas, and J.R.R. Tolkien (all likely They) created their own systems (Math, Science, Technology, Film, and Literature, respectively). They are often avid science fiction and fantasy readers/writers, enjoying alternative worlds that stimulate their imagination and are much more logically systematized than ours, where it is not uncommon for an XXXX to feel out of place."
INTP,"They are natural skeptics and one of the types most likely to initially challenge the underlying principles of personality type. Things are rarely black and white for them, as they see all of the nuances or shades of grey in an issue. They err on the side of over-analyzing a topic, considering all of the challenges that may arise way into the future. They occasionally overreact with an emotional tone (much to their chagrin) if they are frustrated by the inconsistent logic of another’s position, or if their competence is questioned."
INTP,"They are convinced only by logic. They are a little obsessed with logical correctness. They virtually never base a decision on subjective emotional considerations. In fact, they are not always in tune with their own or others’ emotional states or needs. This can occasionally get them into trouble, if they poke holes in others’ theories or bluntly point out logical inconsistencies in their position."
INTP,"They tend to work in bursts of inspiration when they are fully engaged – but tasks they find boring can be a real challenge. They often struggle with staying organized. They are most inspired at the beginning of a new project during the strategy, vision setting, and problem solving stages. Once the plan has been worked out, they’d love nothing more than to pass it off and move on to the next complex problem."
INTP,"Be highly imaginative, even as adults. Be technologically savvy. Gravitate towards cutting edge approaches (especially technology). Highly value intelligence in friendships. Challenge the status quo. Provide maximum autonomy as a boss. Prefer that their work speak for itself (and avoid self promoting). NOT be seen as a someone who “aims to please others”. Be a serial hobbyist. Be seen as independent (in every way)"
INTJ,"Tenacious. Private. Deep. Intellectual. Future-focused. Independent. Driven. Intense. Reserved. Direct"
INTJ,"There are two phases of most projects or meetings: 1) the vision and strategy setting stage; and 2) the execution stage. They tend to gravitate towards the former. Highly future focused, out-of-the-box, logic-driven thinkers, few can match the XXXX’s capacity when it comes to doing what they love - developing long-term strategies and solving complex problems that involve a lot of moving pieces. An XXXX’s mind is unconventional and unrestricted by previous approaches or traditional thinking."
INTJ,"“Good enough” is not typically part of the vocabulary of an XXXX. They have extremely high standards for both themselves and others, and a tremendous stamina for hard work. They constantly push themselves to achieve excellence in all of their endeavors, which often translates into long hours with more focus and fewer breaks in concentration than most other personality types."
INTJ,"Of all the 16 types, They have perhaps the highest need for continuous learning, and to constantly challenge themselves intellectually. They thrive when they are progressively working towards higher and higher levels of competency and excellence, and are easily bored by assignments or tasks that they have mastered before - or have a straightforward execution."
INTJ,"Rather impervious to criticism and highly intrinsically motivated, They are among the most independent of all the types, and thrive working productively alone for long periods of time. They tend to hold themselves to their own high standards, not looking to others for frequent validation. As a type, They are often uncomfortable giving compliments and regular positive feedback. Finesse is also not a natural gift for They, and if not careful, they can be direct to the point of being blunt - and come across as intimidating or offensive."
INTJ,"They are often well known for their insightful, thoughtful, and unique perspective. Their best ideas and solutions to complex problems usually come after they’ve mulled the topic over for a while. This “percolating” process can take a couple of days, is not always conscious, and more often than not, leads to a solution that just “pops” into their heads out of nowhere when they are alone, relaxed, and are engaged in or thinking about a completely different topic."
INTJ,"Underneath that calm, cool exterior is one of the most rich and well-developed inner worlds of any of the 16 types. The brain of an XXXX is always “on,” processing the complex issues and strategies that They love to tackle (even while they are watching TV). At times, they can be so lost in their thoughts that they walk past people who are saying “hi” in the hallway - and have a hard time quickly switching gears when interrupted at their desk."
INTJ,"Miss what is going on around them because they are lost in thought. Push themselves harder than any other type. Work for LONG stretches of time without a break. Talk over others’ heads without realizing it. Do exceptionally well on standardized tests; achieve excellent academic grades. Under-compliment and over-criticize. Have a top-notch vocabulary and be an avid reader. Catch on to a new idea, concept or approach quickly. Need significant time alone each day to feel optimally recharged. Have solutions just pop into their head out of nowhere"
INFP,"Sensitive. Caring. Empathetic. Flexible. Casual. Spontaneous. Reserved. Modest. Calm. Unique"
INFP,"There’s no doubt about it, They are unique. They lead their lives according to an inner compass that can often lead them off the beaten path and in their own direction. They are also gifted with a creative spark that allows them to generate new, unconventional and even revolutionary ideas. Their thoughts and ideas are frequently focused on people, and they have an easy time relating to - and understanding - their fellow human beings. In fact, They often appear to have an x-ray vision into the inner-workings of other people. Most successful They attribute success to an innate ability to flex their style to meet others more than halfway. This makes them naturals at effective communication, and they are usually considered to be excellent listeners – rarely judging, just seeking to understand."
INFP,"Flexible, casual, spontaneous and easy going, They like to leave their options open as long as possible. It is not uncommon for them to struggle to stay organized, and they can be easily distracted from the task at hand. Luckily, they actually prefer to prepare rather last minute when the urgency is high. They tend to work in bursts of inspiration and take a lot of mini-breaks, rather than steadily throughout the day or week. They tend to be very flexible and open to changing plans last minute."
INFP,"They are “idea generators” much more than they are “detail people,” and they love to discover “win-win” solutions that have a long- term positive impact on people. There are two phases of most projects or meetings: 1) the initial “big picture,” “vision setting” stage; and 2) the logistics or “action items” stage. Innovative visionaries, They shine during the former, gaining much more energy from envisioning future possibilities and idea generating then from completing concrete tasks. They tend to lose steam toward the end of projects when everything is decided."
INFP,"They have very strong personal values, which have a large impact on their actions and decisions. They seek to feel that they are living their lives in accordance with their values and what “feels” right to them. Unlike their XXXX colleagues (who are exceptionally logic driven), They are uncomfortable making decisions based predominantly on impersonal, logical analysis. They trust their hunches more than most, and have a tendency to read between the lines of what others are saying more than any other type."
INFP,"They tend to have a relaxed outward appearance that has a calming influence on others. Reserved and modest, They are not likely to “advertise” their own strengths, and it can take many encounters to get to know them. First impressions do not always give a sense of their incredible warmth, generosity, and kindness."
INFP,"Inside the mind of all They is a rich, well-developed inner world that they tend to keep rather private. They are one of the most sympathetic types, who genuinely care about and enjoy people, and strongly value their relationships. Being in highly social environments tends to drain their energy, and they crave time inside their own head to process and recharge. With those in their “inner circle,” They show a much more talkative, passionate, and enthusiastic side."
INFP,"Read between the lines. Have a “sixth sense” at times. Follow their hunches; make decisions based on what “feels” right. Value uniqueness and originality in themselves and others. Reflect on who they really are, and on the meaning and purpose of life. Do work that has personal meaning for them and betters others’ lives. Have a calming influence on others. Not follow “the pack”. Enjoy an assignment with maximum creative license. Give others the benefit of the doubt"
INFJ,"Empathetic. Visionary. Perfectionistic. Value-Driven. Conscientious. Planful. Private. Reserved. Idealistic. Sensitive"
INFJ,"They are “idea generators” much more than they are “detail people,” and they love to discover “win-win” solutions that have a long term positive impact on people. There are two phases of most projects or meetings: 1) the initial “big picture,” “vision setting” stage; and 2) the logistics or “action items” stage. Highly intellectually curious, They shine during the former, and gain much more energy from “noodling” abstract concepts and ideas than doing straightforward detail-based execution. They spend more time than most reflecting on the complex nuances or shades of grey in issues. While they are perfectionists with exceptional work ethics, They report that remembering concrete details shared verbally is not a natural gift. As a result, they tend to rely heavily on copious note taking."
INFJ,"Inside the mind of all They is a rich, well developed inner world that they tend to keep rather private. While they enjoy socializing and highly value relationships, an XXXX’s energy is quickly drained by highly active, social environments. Their best ideas come after they’ve had time to mull over the topic in their head for a while. This “percolating” process can take a couple of days, is not always conscious, and usually leads to a solution that just “pops” into their head."
INFJ,"Highly emotionally intelligent, They love to inspire others, help them gain a new perspective, and reach their maximum potential in life. They tend to feel things very deeply and be sensitive in every sense of the word. With a particularly low tolerance for conflict, They work to avoid unnecessary tension or confrontation, and are more likely than most types to take criticism personally. They tend to spend a great deal of time preparing for and then reflecting on any negative interactions, and also tend to second- guess their decisions."
INFJ,"“Good enough” is not typically part of the vocabulary for the XXXX. Blessed with tremendous focus, will power, and perseverance, They constantly push themselves to reach any goal they have set out to achieve. Striving to avoid “winging it” or surprises, They find lack of closure and future “unknowns” to be more anxiety-producing than most types. As a result, they prefer to plan way ahead, and over-prepare whenever possible. Not natural multi-taskers, They tend to do best when focused exclusively on one conversation or task at a time."
INFJ,"Private and reserved at first, They are perhaps the type that is the most difficult to judge by a first impression. Only as part of their inner circle do you really get to know the warmth, passion, insight, empathy and witty humor of an XXXX. While they can sometimes come across on the serious (and even a bit unapproachable) side at first, the more time you spend with them, the more you grow to appreciate the depth of their wisdom and insights about both people."
INFJ,"They tend to be avid fiction readers, as this pursuit provides They with much needed recharge time. They likely see themselves in many of the main characters, who are often They, as fiction novel authors are commonly They. To the rarest type (approximately 2% of the population), always on a quest to better understand themselves, this is both appealing and validating!"
INFJ,"Be highly ethical with exceptional integrity. Virtually never compromise their personal values. Treat each individual differently based on their needs/personality. Be too hard on themselves; perfectionistic. Seek spiritual fulfillment. Feel anxiety and worry about future “unknowns”. Find it difficult to stay focused on the present moment. Aim to know themselves as deeply and thoroughly as possible. Leave an organization based on lack of shared values. Take criticism to heart"

ISTJ,"If your closest personality type is XXXX then you are interested in clarity and knowledge. You like to observe and listen, and have a particular interest in facts and information which help you to develop as clear a knowledge as possible. You like to know where you stand, e.g.: having clear goals to which you are working, and to know that what you are expected to do is achievable. You value your experience, which serves as a strong guide to your decisions."
ISTJ,"The dominant function of an XXXX is the perceptive one of Sensing. This means you like looking at information in terms of facts and details, focusing more on the here and now rather than possibilities for the future. You feel comfortable in areas of proven experience, and take a realistic approach."
ISTJ,"The perceptive Sensing function is introverted. That is, Sensing is used primarily to govern the inner world of thoughts and emotions. You seek to develop a realistic understanding of the world as it is, in the light of what you observe. You are pragmatic in nature, constantly learning to adapt to the world as it is now, and are continually expanding your inner store of facts, information and experience."
ISTJ,"The potential ways in which an XXXX can irritate others include focusing too much on the current task at the expense of longer term or interpersonal issues, not articulating your understanding of the situation, and not seeing the wood for the trees. Others may see you as being too serious, seeming to be inflexible, not encouraging others to experiment or innovate, and not promoting his/her own ideas or contributions."
ISTJ,"As with all types, an XXXX can achieve personal growth by developing those functions that are not fully developed, through actions such as developing a long term vision, or changing things on an experimental basis to see if you can be improved. You may also need to articulate your own views more, whilst avoiding too much detail and taking more account of how people will feel. It is the issue of change that perhaps presents the greatest challenge, however, as you need to find the right balance between preserving what works whilst being open to experimental new ideas where some will fail but others will reveal better ways of doing things."
ISTJ,"As stress increases, 'learned behaviour' tends to give way to the natural style, so an XXXX will behave more according to type when under greater stress. For example, in a crisis, you might find a place of solitude in which to think and work, collect more data/information, or use tried and trusted means of solving problems. However, you may also criticise others' efforts (when they, themselves, are under stress), and use pragmatic solutions at the expense of the long term."
ISTJ,"The careers chosen most often by They (according to our research with people already in work) include medical, science, engineering, analysis, accountancy, academia, law, computing, project management."
ISFJ,"If your closest personality type is XXXX then you are interested in knowledge and experience, particularly in relation to family, friends and colleagues. You are a quiet, serious observer of people, listening intently and getting to know a great deal about them. You pay attention to their emotions and feelings, and are keenly aware of the state of relationships between them and you take your responsibilities to them very seriously."
ISFJ,"The dominant function of an XXXX is the perceptive one of Sensing. This means you take a realistic approach, like looking at information in terms of facts and details, focus more on the here and now rather than possibilities for the future, and feel comfortable in areas of proven experience."
ISFJ,"The perceptive Sensing function is introverted. That is, Sensing is used primarily to govern the inner world of thoughts and emotions. You seek to develop a realistic understanding of people as they are now and, being pragmatic in nature, adapt to the world as it is rather than trying to effect too much change. You observe in a subjective way, selecting and relating facts that others might not, whilst seeing those facts more in terms of their significance rather than pure 'data'."
ISFJ,"The potential ways in which an XXXX can irritate others include avoiding conflict, not giving criticism when it is needed, and not articulating his/her understanding of the situation. You may be so focused on your own knowledge that you don't see the wood for the trees and you resist change (though not openly). You may also fail to look after your own needs, or not promote sufficiently your own ideas or contributions."
ISFJ,"As with all types, an XXXX can achieve personal growth by developing those functions that are not fully developed, through actions that are much more change oriented. You may need to learn how to 'give things a try' when the outcome is uncertain, develop a long term version that looks beyond existing areas of knowledge, and become more comfortable in dealing with conflict and/or taking control. For example, others may at times find constructive criticism more helpful than just encouragement on its own, and sometimes they may prefer to be given direct instructions rather than invited to express their opinion on every team decision."
ISFJ,"As stress increases, 'learned behaviour' tends to give way to the natural style, so the XXXX will behave more according to type when under greater stress. For example, in a crisis, the XXXX might find a place of solitude in which to think and work, whilst nevertheless valuing the efforts of others and encourage everyone about how well they are coping. However, you may fail to recognise the need for change, or be unwilling to try new solutions that are better than conventional solutions."
ISFJ,"The careers chosen most often by They (according to our research with people already in work) include design, teaching, personal assistant, research, administration, medical, human resources."
INFJ,"If your closest personality type is XXXX then you have a strong, private sense of knowledge and vision, often for hidden things that other people would think can't be known. You see imaginative possibilities and insights, especially in relation to people, anticipating a future for them that they can't even see themselves. Although you probably have some strong relationships, your insights may be so unusual that others find them difficult to accept, and you may therefore find it difficult to articulate them."
INFJ,"The dominant function of an XXXX is the perceptive one of iNtuition. This means you like looking at information from a global viewpoint, spotting patterns and relationships, that leads to an understanding of the key issues. You tend to focus more on possibilities for the future than the here-and-now, and you enjoy gaining insights into people and where they may be going in the future."
INFJ,"The perceptive iNtuition function is introverted. That is, iNtuition is used primarily to govern the inner world of thoughts and emotions. You therefore seek to develop a deep understanding of people, relating your observations of people to underlying aspects of the human psyche, that everyone shares. You are strategic in nature, wanting to establish a clear vision towards which you are working, though that vision is somewhat private, as you tend not to involve others in its development."
INFJ,"The potential ways in which an XXXX can irritate others include not including others sufficiently in the vision, not giving criticism or expressing disagreement when it is appropriate, and ignoring current realities in pursuit of a more enduring insight and meaning. You may overlook some tasks that need to be done, make errors of fact, and want to pursue idealistic plans without fully thinking through the tangible consequences (e.g.: the cost or logistics involved)."
INFJ,"As with all types, an XXXX can achieve personal growth by developing those functions that are not fully developed, through actions such as involving others in the development of one's own personal vision or goals, investigating and collating hard facts/data, and learning how to plan and control projects. It is the area of logistics that presents the greatest challenge, and potential for growth, for that doesn't depend on people's growth or development and it requires taking a more objective approach than is natural for an XXXX."
INFJ,"As stress increases, 'learned behaviour' tends to give way to the natural style, so the XXXX will behave more according to type when under greater stress. For example, in a crisis, the XXXX might find a place of solitude in which to think and work, tell everyone else that you are coping, but focus primarily on trying to solve the long term problem. This means you may neglect the short term issues, make errors of fact, or ignore routine matters that might nevertheless be essential."
INFJ,"The careers chosen most often by They (according to our research with people already in work) include writing, psychology, librarian, counselling, home making, the arts, design, marketing."
INTJ,"If your closest personality type is XXXX then you have a strong, private sense of strategic vision, both for the future and how that future can be achieved. Your vision, or sense of knowing, may be difficult to articulate. Others may find your vision difficult to accept, seeing it as impractical or unrealistic. Pursuing your vision might be a lonely task, therefore, as you develop and pursue plans without anyone else really understanding the nature of what you are trying to achieve."
INTJ,"The dominant function of an XXXX is the perceptive one of iNtuition. This means you like looking at information from a global viewpoint, spotting new patterns and relationships that lead to an understanding of the key issues. You focus more on possibilities for the future than the here-and-now, and you enjoy intellectual challenges and variety."
INTJ,"The perceptive iNtuition function is introverted. That is, iNtuition is used primarily to govern the inner world of thoughts and emotions. You may therefore seek to develop a understanding of how the world can be, wanting to understand the patterns underlying your observations of the world around you and the way in which the team or organisation works. You are strategic in nature, wanting to establish a clear vision towards which you and the team are working, though you tend not to involve others in the development of that vision."
INTJ,"The potential ways in which an XXXX can irritate others include being single-minded or stubborn, not taking sufficient account of current realities, and not expressing appreciation for the contributions of others (particularly where it hasn't been fully competent). You may not delegate enough, and to others it can appear that you make decisions that are unrelated to the present facts."
INTJ,"As with all types, an XXXX can achieve personal growth by developing those functions that are not fully developed, through actions such as articulating the XXXX's vision, and allowing others to contribute to its development, expressing appreciation for work done, even when it falls short of the XXXX's personal standards, and investigating the facts and documenting them before interpreting what they mean. You may need to consider the impact of your approach and ideas on other people's feelings, looking for and acknowledging positive contributions and areas of agreement, rather than just seeing flaws and areas of disagreement."
INTJ,"As stress increases, 'learned behaviour' tends to give way to the natural style, so an XXXX will behave more according to type when under greater stress. For example, in a crisis, you might retire to a private place and think through a problem until you have formulated a complete plan for solving it. Through trying to maintain a high degree of quality in the solution, you may end up criticising other people (even when they are under stress), make errors of fact, and not be prepared to make reasonable compromises."
INTJ,"The careers chosen most often by They (according to our research with people already in work) include academia, computing, engineering, science, project management, research, management."
ISTP,"If your closest personality type is XXXX then you have both a logical and a practical mind and therefore enjoy solving tangible problems. You are very interested in how things work, and may have a tendency to take things apart if you don't know how they work. You may also enjoy using your craftmanslike skills to fix things that are broken, or doing investigative work, collecting facts and clues to find out the truth of what has happened."
ISTP,"The dominant function of an XXXX is the judging one of Thinking. This means you like making decisions on the basis of logic, using objective considerations, and are concerned with truth, principles and justice. You are analytical and critical, tending to see the flaws in situations and you usually (though not always) take an objective approach when dealing with people or problems."
ISTP,"The judging Thinking function is introverted. That is, Thinking is used primarily to govern the inner world of thoughts and emotions. As an XXXX you will therefore spend time thinking analytically, organising thoughts on a logical basis and developing an understanding of the principles involved in a situation. You may spontaneously tend to feel critical of a person or situation, but not necessarily express that criticism. Also, although you are inwardly decisive, you may not communicate your decisions to others (so they don't always realise when you've made your mind up). You tend to think mostly about impersonal issues, focusing more on practical concepts, truth and how things work rather than dwelling on people's feelings and emotions."
ISTP,"The potential ways in which an XXXX can irritate other team members includes focusing too much on the current task at the expense of longer term or interpersonal issues, not seeing the wood for the trees and not completing a task before moving on to the next one. Colleagues may find it frustrating if you don't communicate fully your understanding of the situation, if you take shortcuts, of it (to them) it seems as if you flit from one thing to another."
ISTP,"As with all types, an XXXX can achieve personal growth by developing all functions that are not fully developed, through actions such as taking time to consider the impact of the XXXX's approach and ideas on people's feelings, or expressing appreciation towards others. You may need to learn to consult others, and to engender wider ownership of the solution. You may also need to acknowledge and develop your own emotions and personal values, develop a long term personal strategy, and look at personal or networking relationships as having value in themselves, rather than just focusing on collaborative relationships that work towards a particular goal."
ISTP,"As stress increases, 'learned behaviour' tends to give way to the natural style, so an XXXX will behave more according to type when under greater stress. For example, in a crisis, the XXXX might withdraw from people, to think through possible solutions, and use tried and trusted solutions to short-term problems. The XXXX may also tend to criticise others efforts and ignore their feelings, and focus on sorting out detailed points that could perhaps wait."
ISTP,"The careers chosen most often by They (according to our research with people already in work) include computing, engineering, management, medical, technical specialist, accountancy, administration."
ISFP,"If your closest personality type is XXXX then you have some deeply-held values that, even though your life may be somewhat unstructured, direct the things that you do and say. You probably take a caring and sensitive approach to others, more so than may be apparent to others because you showing your feelings in acts of kindness rather than in direct statements. You probably have a strong sense of the type of lifestyle you enjoy, which you want to maintain."
ISFP,"The dominant function of an XXXX is the judging one of Feeling. This means you make decisions on the basis of personal values, are appreciative and accepting of people - enjoying company and seeking harmony. You assess the impact of your decisions on others, are sympathetic and compassionate, and take a friendly, personal approach."
ISFP,"The judging Feeling function is introverted. That is, Feeling is used primarily to govern the inner world of thoughts and emotions. The XXXX will therefore develop an inner emotional life that is often unseen to others, but is experienced as intense. You have a strong sense of values, which are often not expressed, which you use to emotionally accept or reject various aspects of life. Although you feel appreciation towards others, you may not express it that often."
ISFP,"The potential ways in which an XXXX can irritate others include being too concerned with harmony in the group, not pushing the XXXX's own ideas and contribution enough, and eing stubborn over issues the group did not anticipate being a problem. By trying to avoid conflict you may fail to give (constructive) criticism when it is needed. You may also focus so much on interpersonal issues that objective considerations (e.g.: udgets, timescales, quality) take second place. You may also perhaps fail to take a longer term view and, taking people too much at face value, not recognise hidden agendas or motives."
ISFP,"As with all types, an XXXX can achieve personal growth by developing those functions that are not fully developed, through actions such as learning how to express disagreement or criticism in a constructive way, making and implementing detailed plans, or giving direct instructions when it is appropriate to do so. You may need to learn to be more open about your personal values, so it is less of a surprise when colleagues infringe them, and establish a long term goal to work towards."
ISFP,"As stress increases, 'learned behaviour' tends to give way to the natural style, so an XXXX will behave more according to type when under greater stress. For example, in a crisis, the XXXX might concentrate on what the XXXX sees as important, and work alone if possible. However, you may also act impulsively and take risks, failing to consider longer-term or objective implications (e.g.: future cost)."
ISFP,"The careers chosen most often by They (according to our research with people already in work) include the arts, personal assistant, teaching, computing, accountancy, administration, nursing."
INFP,"If your closest personality type is XXXX then you have some deeply-held values, though there are probably very few people, if any, who know what those values actually are. Privately, you may be a people-person, but others may not recognise it as you show your feelings in indirect, imaginative ways rather than in more conventional expressions of care. You may be looking forward to the realisation of some personal ideals."
INFP,"The dominant function of an XXXX is the judging one of Feeling. This means you make decisions on the basis of personal values, are appreciative and accepting of people - enjoying company and seeking harmony.

You retain a strong sense of values, which are often not expressed, and you emotionally accept or reject various aspects of life. You may feel appreciation towards others, but do not often express it."
INFP,"The potential ways in which an XXXX can irritate others include being too idealistic, appearing out of touch, and being disorganised. Because you have strong but private values, the team may find you unexpectedly stubborn over some issues that the group did not anticipate being a problem. You may spend too much time thinking, focusing so much on the issues that are important to you that you do not take into account the values and beliefs of other team members. You may also feel uncomfortable with conflict and therefore tend to try to avoid it."
INFP,"As with all types, They can achieve personal growth by developing all functions that are not fully developed, through actions such as developing plans, organising your work area and, when making important decisions, listing options and including a formal cost benefit analysis. You may also need to be more open about your personal values, and pay more attention to the current problems that need solving. You could perhaps learn to enjoy the present more, rather than always working towards a better future."
INFP,"As stress increases, 'learned behaviour' tends to give way to the natural style, so the XXXX will behave more according to type when under greater stress. For example, in a crisis, you might concentrate only on what you see as important, work alone if possible, or contribute creative ideas. However, you may also overlook current realities and fail to consider the objective or practical implications of your decisions."
INFP,"The careers chosen most often by They (according to our research with people already in work) include the arts, writing, counselling, design, the ministry, academia, technical specialist, psychology."
INTP,"If your closest personality type is XXXX then you have a strong sense of the hidden principles that govern how the world works. You are interested in theoretical models and explanations, and when other people put forward their own theories you put them to the test to find out how true or robust they are. You enjoy solving difficult intellectual problems and seek to understand the real truth behind any situation, even when it involves several complex factors."
INTP,"The dominant function of an XXXX is the judging one of Thinking. This means you like making decisions on the basis of logic, using objective considerations, and are concerned with truth, principles and justice. You are analytical and critical, tending to see the flaws in situations, and take an objective, detached approach."
INTP,"The judging Thinking function is introverted. That is, thinking is used primarily to govern the inner world of thoughts and emotions. You will therefore spend time thinking analytically to develop an understanding of the principles involved in a situation. You may tend to spontaneously feel critical of a person or situation, but not necessarily express that criticism. Also, you are inwardly decisive, but you do not necessarily communicate those decisions to others. You think mostly about impersonal issues, focusing more on concepts, truths and systems rather than individuals' feelings."
INTP,"The potential ways in which an XXXX can irritate others include being too intellectual, finding too many flaws, and not accepting imperfect but 'good enough' solutions. You may not only maintain an independent stance, but also fail to take sufficient account of others' feelings, clinging to a principle at the expense of relationships and harmony. You may suggest ideas but then appear to change your mind, and leave others to worry about implementation once you have solved the problem intellectually."
INTP,"As with all types, an XXXX can achieve personal growth by developing all functions that are not fully developed, through actions such as expressing appreciation towards others, working within other people's limitations, and accepting and praising others' imperfect efforts. You may need to learn to put up with 'good enough' efforts, consult others more, and involving them in decisions to engender collective ownership of the solution. You may also benefit from spending time to develop personal relationships for their own sake, and also from learning to acknowledge and develop your own emotions and personal values."
INTP,"As stress increases, 'learned behaviour' tends to give way to the natural style, so an XXXX will behave more according to type when under greater stress. For example, in a crisis, the XXXX might withdraw to think about the central issue that needs attention, suggest various ideas, and use the feedback received to help improve the intellectual analysis. You may also debate the issue from an intellectual point of view, criticise others efforts, ignore their feelings (when they themselves may be under stress) and leave it very late before making a decision."
INTP,"The careers chosen most often by They (according to our research with people already in work) include analysis, research, science, counselling, entrepreneurship, technical specialist, academia."
ESTJ,"If your closest personality type is XXXX then you want the world to be well run and well organised. You are keenly aware of the need for structure in a situation, such as the roles and responsibilities that people have. If there are no established processes or procedures, or in a situation of chaos, then you will introduce a logical organisation and structure into the way things are done. You are likely to be businesslike and professional in your manner."
ESTJ,"The dominant function of an XXXX is the judging one of Thinking. This means you like making decisions on the basis of logic, using objective considerations, are concerned with truth, principles and justice, are analytical and critical, tending to see the flaws in situations, and take an objective approach."
ESTJ,"The judging Thinking function is extraverted. That is, thinking is used primarily to govern the outer world of actions and spoken words. You are therefore likely to organise life and work on a logical basis - classifying, ordering, and directing facts and situations. You tend to be decisive, with the aim of being just and fair, and are comfortable with conflict as a way of resolving problems. You are professional rather than personal in your approach, tending to focus more on systems and organisational needs than each individuals' feelings."
ESTJ,"The potential ways in which an XXXX can irritate others include focusing too much on the current task at the expense of broader interpersonal issues, being too blunt in giving criticism, not seeing the wood for the trees, not encouraging others to experiment or innovate, and not paying enough attention to others' feelings and values."
ESTJ,"As with all types, an XXXX can achieve personal growth by developing those functions that are not fully developed, through actions such as taking time to consider the impact of your approach and ideas on people's feelings, expressing appreciation towards others, and consulting others more. You can engender more ownership of the solution in the team if they realise you value their own contributions and incorporate their views into collective decision making. You may need to learn to acknowledge and accept the positive role that can be played by your own emotions, and also work within your own and other people's limitations rather than expecting them to be fully competent all the time."
ESTJ,"As stress increases, 'learned behaviour' tends to give way to the natural style, so the XXXX will behave more according to type when under greater stress. For example, in a crisis, you might take command, decide what needs to be done, tell everyone what to do, and use tried and trusted solutions to short-term problems. However, you may also make decisions too quickly and, without considering the impact on people, criticise others efforts and ignore their feelings (when they, also, are under stress)."
ESTJ,"The careers chosen most often by They (according to our research with people already in work) include law, human resources, training, nursing, management, project management, administration."
ESFJ,"If your closest personality type is XXXX then you seek to develop harmony in relationships, and promote cooperation and teamwork. You regard the needs of others as very important, perhaps more so than your own, and seek to recognise their contributions and make them feel valued. You encourage and motivate others, engender team spirit, and try to overcome any conflict by finding common ground and ways in which people can agree."
ESFJ,"The dominant function of an XXXX is the judging one of Feeling. This means you make decisions on the basis of personal values, are appreciative and accepting of people, enjoy company and seek harmony. You assess the impact of your decisions on others, are sympathetic or compassionate, and take a personal and friendly approach."
ESFJ,"The judging Feeling function is extraverted. That is, Feeling is used primarily to govern the outer world of people and things, or actions and spoken words. You therefore tend to seek stable, harmonious relationships, and tend to adapt to the environment - taking on board those values that are held as important by friends and family, or society as a whole. You are likely to express the appreciation that you feel towards others, consider their feelings before your own. You may be sensitive to praise and criticism, and seek to conform to others' reasonable expectations."
ESFJ,"The potential ways in which an XXXX can irritate others include talking too much, assuming you know the needs of others, and avoiding conflict to the extent of not giving criticism when it is needed. You may not pay enough attention to your own needs and, perhaps not seeing the wood for the trees, are sometimes reluctant to try out new things or work towards new possibilities."
ESFJ,"As with all types, an XXXX can achieve personal growth by developing those functions that are not fully developed, through actions such as doing analytical tasks (such as cost benefit analyses), and learning how to be (constructively) critical of others. Rather than assuming you know what people want, you may need to encourage others to articulate their own needs and use active listening to verify your understanding. You might also benefit from establishing a list of your own, personal needs and trying to identify ways in which both sets of needs can be met. It may also be helpful to establish a long term goal but, in working towards it, also being prepared to modify it in the light of new experience and changing circumstances."
ESFJ,"As stress increases, 'learned behaviour' tends to give way to the natural style, so the XXXX will behave more according to type when under greater stress. For example, in a crisis, the XXXX might work hard to complete pre-defined tasks, express appreciation for everyone else's efforts, and see the positive contribution that others are making. However, you may also fail to recognise the need for change, or the negative impact of the people you admire, and you may neglect your own needs whilst being concerned for others."
ESFJ,"The careers chosen most often by They (according to our research with people already in work) include nursing, home making, medical, training, administration, teaching, personal assistant."
ENFJ,"If your closest personality type is XXXX then you are someone who seeks to develop and promote personal growth in your friends, family or colleagues. You sometimes have a sense of their potential which may extend beyond how they see themselves. You also seek to develop the potential within relationships or the team. However, you don't push so hard that it creates conflict, because keeping the harmony in your relationships is also important."
ENFJ,"The dominant function of an XXXX is the judging one of Feeling. This means you make decisions on the basis of personal values and are appreciative/accepting of people. You enjoy company and seek harmony, assess the impact of decisions on others, and you are sympathetic or compassionate, taking a personal approach."
ENFJ,"The judging Feeling function is extraverted. That is, feeling is used primarily to govern the outer world of actions and spoken words.

You tend to express the appreciation that you feel towards others and consider others' feelings before your own. You are sensitive to praise and criticism, and seek to accommodate others' (reasonable) expectations as far as possible."
ENFJ,"The potential ways in which an XXXX can irritate others include talking too much and assuming to know the needs of others. In trying to help others develop insight, you may appear as both bossy and also as avoiding conflict (e.g.: not giving criticism when it is needed). You may also tend to take criticism personally, focusing so much on interpersonal issues that impersonal or business issues (such as cost or performance management) are not adequately addressed."
ENFJ,"As with all types, an XXXX can achieve personal growth by developing any functions that are not fully developed, through actions such as learning to observe and accept the negative aspects of those people you admire, undertaking a critical appraisal of a situation or person, and expressing disagreement or criticism when it could be of value to the recipient. You may need to find an independent and objective means of verifying your insights about people, as they may be coloured by your subjective viewpoint. You may also need to pause and think more, to encourage others to articulate their own needs and use active listening to verify your understanding."
ENFJ,"As stress increases, 'learned behaviour' tends to give way to the natural style, so an XXXX will typically behave more according to type when under greater stress. For example, in a crisis, the XXXX might get everyone organised, express appreciation for their efforts, contribute creative ideas, but overlook current realities and fail to consider the cost implications."
ENFJ,"The careers chosen most often by They (according to our research with people already in work) include counselling, teaching, human resources, sales, nursing, administration, management."
ENTJ,"If your closest personality type is XXXX then you are looking to develop a better structure and organisation in the way things are done. You tend to control life by organising systems and people to meet task oriented goals, but you also have one eye on the future and are looking for a process of continuous improvement. You like to work with competent people who, being in the right roles, have the appropriate skills both to do their job and implement the improvements you envisage."
ENTJ,"The dominant function of an XXXX is the judging one of Thinking. This means you like making decisions on the basis of logic, using objective considerations, and are concerned with truth, principles and justice. You are analytical and critical, tending to see the flaws in situations, and take a task-oriented approach in your dealings with people."
ENTJ,"The judging Thinking function is extraverted. That is, thinking is used primarily to govern the outer world of actions and spoken words. The XXXX will therefore organise life in on a logical basis, classifying, ordering, and directing facts and situations. You are probably decisive, with the aim of being just and fair, and comfortable with conflict as a way of resolving problems. In your work you probably take an impersonal approach, spontaneously tending to criticise, and focusing more on systems and organisational needs than each individuals' feelings."
ENTJ,"The potential ways in which an XXXX can irritate others include taking control when it is their role to do so, issuing directives sometimes without explaining the reasons why, and dominating the team. Also, if you are in charge, you may not take sufficient account of others' feelings, and drive the team too hard. There may also be a possibility that you decide too quickly, without sufficient consultation with others, and don't take sufficient account of current realities. As a result you may end up introducing too much change, rather than leaving well-established, workable routines alone."
ENTJ,"As with all types, They can achieve personal growth by developing those functions that are not fully developed, through actions such as pausing and thinking, and taking time to consider your own values and emotions, and consider the impact of your approach on other people's values and feelings. You may need to learn that others are more likely to accept your decisions if you consult them more - i.e.: by demonstrating that their own contributions are accepted and incorporated into a collective decision you will engender ownership of the solution amongst the team. You may also need to become more tolerant of other people's limitations, expressing appreciation for what they are good at rather than focus on their failings."
ENTJ,"As stress increases, 'learned behaviour' tends to give way to the natural style, so the XXXX will behave more according to type when under greater stress. For example, in a crisis, the XXXX might take control, decide what needs to be done, and tell everyone what to do. Under mild stress They maintain a sense of direction, and drive others hard to overcome any short term difficulties, though there may also be a tendency to make decisions too quickly and, without considering the impact on people who are also under stress, criticise their efforts and ignore their feelings."
ENTJ,"The careers chosen most often by They (according to our research with people already in work) include project management, management, human resources, technical specialist, engineering, administration."
ESTP,"If your closest personality type is XXXX then you are an action oriented problem solver. You enjoy getting things done, and taking action to solve practical problems. You are in your element when there is a crisis requiring urgent action, which you are able to resolve. If you have any particular skills (e.g.: sports, crafts or sales) then you enjoy applying those skills to reach a tangible goal (winning a game, making a sale, or building something tangible)."
ESTP,"The dominant function of an XXXX is the perceptive one of Sensing. This means you like looking at information in terms of facts and details, focus more on the here and now rather than possibilities for the future, feel comfortable in areas of proven experience, and take a realistic approach."
ESTP,"The perceptive Sensing function is extraverted. That is, Sensing is used primarily to govern the outer world of actions and spoken words. You therefore probably seek to experience and enjoy the world as it is, being very responsive to current events and, being pragmatic in nature, life tends to be a succession of events. You keep looking for problems to solve and are in your element when you are up against an urgent problem or trouble-shooting."
ESTP,"The potential ways in which an XXXX can irritate others include acting too quickly, without appearing to think things through, and focusing too much on the current task at the expense of longer term or interpersonal issues. If you get caught up in the immediate crisis, you may not see the wood for the trees, nor take account of the sensitivities of others. You may also turn to a new problem before the last one has been fully completed, perhaps even generating crises as a way to get things moving in the right direction."
ESTP,"As with all types, an XXXX can achieve personal growth by developing those functions that are not fully developed, through actions such as developing a long term vision, and ensuring that all aspects of a task have been completed before going on to the next one. You may need to develop greater tolerance for 'things running smoothly', otherwise you may get bored and lose interest. It may also be helpful for you to pay more attention to your hunches and intuitions."
ESTP,"As stress increases, 'learned behaviour' tends to give way to the natural style, so an XXXX will behave more according to type when under greater stress. For example, in a crisis, you might use your energy to overcome whatever obstacles get in the way, generate new actions, and use tried and trusted means of solving problems. However, your use of pragmatic solutions may be at the expense of the long term and take the team in a different direction to the strategy."
ESTP,"The careers chosen most often by They (according to our research with people already in work) include the forces, engineering, management, computing, science, medical, law, sales, accountancy."
ESFP,"If your closest personality type is XXXX then you are an action-oriented people person. You seek to live life to the full, and enjoy applying your people-skills (and other practical skills) to achieve a tangible benefit for people. You have a strong sense of immediacy or urgency - realising what needs to be done now - and are probably often urging your colleagues to stop talking and get on with doing something."
ESFP,"The dominant function of an XXXX is the perceptive one of Sensing. This means you like looking at information in terms of facts and details, focusing more on the here and now rather than possibilities for the future. You feel comfortable in areas with which you are already familiar (as opposed to uncharted territory) and you tend to take a realistic approach."

You may also tend to turn to a new problem before the last one has been fully completed."
ESFP,"As with all types, an XXXX can achieve personal growth by developing all functions that are not fully developed, through actions such as spending more time in planning and preparation. Also, you may need to ensure that all aspects of a task have been completed before going on to the next one. You may also benefit by paying more attention to your hunches and intuitions, and looking for new underlying patterns - e.g.: rather than solving a problem each time it occurs, recognise that there may be a pattern and look for an underlying cause to recurrent problems. You may also benefit from developing time management and project management skills, to help direct your energy in a more efficient way."
ESFP,"As stress increases, 'learned behaviour' tends to give way to the natural style, so the XXXX will behave more according to type when under greater stress. For example, in a crisis, an XXXX might draw in other people to help, and use tried and tested methods of solving problems.

ESFP,"The careers chosen most often by They (according to our research with people already in work) include training, nursing, human resources, teaching, accountancy, sales, medical."
ENFP,"If your closest personality type is XXXX then you are someone who senses the hidden potential in people. You enjoy starting discussion or activities that challenge and stimulate others into having new insights about themselves, which they can then take and apply to their own personal growth. You are enthusiastic about new projects or causes that offer the potential for a beneficial impact on people, especially when it involves breaking new ground."
ENFP,"The dominant function of an XXXX is the perceptive one of iNtuition. This means you like looking at information from a global viewpoint and spotting patterns and relationships that lead to an understanding of the key issues. You focus more on possibilities for the future than the here-and-now, and enjoy change, challenge, and variety."
ENFP,"The perceptive iNtuition function is extraverted. That is, iNtuition is used primarily to govern the outer world of actions and spoken words. They try ideas out, wanting to explore new possibilities and discover, by experience, which ones work. Also, They tend to change procedures to see if any improvement can be made, rather than just operate them. Their approach is one of evolutionary development, but with an eye on the strategy, being more interested in exploring ideas than bringing them to closure."
ENFP,"The potential ways in which an XXXX can irritate others include losing sight of the main purpose of the discussion and going off at tangents. You may initiate too many projects and are therefore not able to deliver on all of them. Some people may think you talk too much, introduce too much change, and don't leave well-established, workable routines alone. They may even suggest you exaggerate or make errors of fact, or at least want to pursue ideas without fully thinking through the consequences in, say, cost terms."
ENFP,"As with all types, an XXXX can achieve personal growth by developing all functions that are not fully developed, through actions such as being selective about starting projects, and producing plans to help identify which ones can be delivered. They sometimes need to learn to stop and think, and recognise that others will accept the XXXX and his/her ideas more if given sufficient time to make their own contribution. They also need to be more tolerant of existing routines that work well, and resist from changing them."
ENFP,"As stress increases, 'learned behaviour' tends to give way to the natural style, so an XXXX will behave more according to type when under greater stress. For example, in a crisis, the XXXX might involve people in brainstorming ideas, be democratic about choosing the solution to use, provide a lot of drive, but try to do too much, make errors of fact, or ignore routine matters that might nevertheless be essential."
ENFP,"The careers chosen most often by They (according to our research with people already in work) include psychology, entrepreneurship, marketing, training, human resources, management, academia."
ENTP,"If your closest personality type is XXXX then you are someone who challenges the status quo, seeking to uncover the hidden potential or new possibilities in different situations. You start projects and introduce change on an experimental basis, not knowing fully what is going to happen, but in the expectation that it will lead to an improvement. You enjoy the challenge of doing something that has not been done before and seems impossible."
ENTP,"The dominant function of an XXXX is the perceptive one of iNtuition. This means you like looking at information from a global viewpoint, spotting new patterns and relationships, that lead to an understanding of the key issues.

ENTP,"The perceptive iNtuition function is extraverted. That is, iNtuition is used primarily to govern the outer world of actions and spoken words. You therefore try ideas out in practice, to explore new possibilities and discover, by experience, which ones work. You prefer to change procedures to see if any improvement can be made, rather than just operate them. You therefore take an evolutionary approach to development, perhaps with an eye on the strategy which can change. You are more interested in exploring ideas than bringing them to closure."
ENTP,"The potential ways in which an XXXX can irritate others include initiating too many projects, and not being able to deliver on all of them. By introducing too much change and not taking sufficient account of current realities, they may not leave well-established, workable routines alone. They may appear to be overly competitive and unappreciative of the contribution of others, leaving someone else to do the routine work, and occasionally make assumptions that aren't necessarily backed up by the facts."
ENTP,"As with all types, an XXXX can achieve personal growth by developing all functions that are not fully developed, through actions such as being selective about the initiation of projects, and making sure that a project is thoroughly complete before starting another one. You may need to learn to appreciate the value of using existing processes that are 'good enough' to do the job, rather than try to change the process to make it even better. You may need to pay more attention to investigating the facts and documenting them, before interpreting what they mean or trying out a new experiment. Also, you may need to consider the impact of your approach and ideas on people's feelings, learning to appreciation more that some people are quite happy with the way things are and aren't necessarily looking to improve everything they do."
ENTP,"As stress increases, 'learned behaviour' tends to give way to the natural style, so the XXXX will behave more according to type when under greater stress. For example, in a crisis, you might spend time bouncing ideas off people, and debating or critiquing what needs to be done. You may also draft in people with proven skills to work on the problem, and provide a lot of drive to get things changed. However, you may also try to do too much, make errors of fact of in your haste, and/or ignore obvious or routine solutions that might nevertheless be effective."
ENTP,"The careers chosen most often by They (according to our research with people already in work) include entrepreneurship, management, accountancy, human resources, sales, research, analysis."
ISTJ,"They tend to enjoy a career if it involves working towards clear goals, with clear lines of authority, responsibility and accountability. They prefer careers that give them the privacy to work without interruption, where they can develop their knowledge and apply their experience to practical work."
ISFJ,"They tend to enjoy a career if it involves helping people and seeing them derive pleasure from the service. They enjoy applying experience to practical work, giving and receiving appreciation, building relationships and reducing conflict, and getting to know individuals on a personal level."

They enjoy having plenty of privacy, and working with intellectually challenging and competent people. They like to have high-level objectives that tackle complex and difficult problems."
ISTP,"They tend to enjoy a career if it involves solving practical problems. They enjoy having freedom and independence to apply their experience to technical or practical work. They enjoy investigating facts to help develop a better understanding or forming explanations of how things work."
ISFP,"They tend to enjoy a career if it involves applying experience to practical work, and supporting values or causes they believe are important. They like working alone, or with individuals they like or whose company they enjoy. Although They tend to be quiet, they like helping others to enjoy themselves."
INFP,"They tend to enjoy a career if it involves independence, creativity, and facilitating individuals' growth through insights. They enjoy improving teamwork through developing the potential of the individual team members, building relationships and reducing conflict."
INTP,"They tend to enjoy a career if it involves intellectual analysis, and conceptual discussions about systems, strategies and models. The enjoy find tackling challenging and complex problems, exploring different explanations of why things happen, and suggesting or evaluating solutions."
ESTJ,"They tend to enjoy a career if it involves a structured working environment, over which the XXXX can exert some control. They like organising and directoring resources to achieve clear objectives, using well-defined processes - e.g. managing projects (of whatever size) to achieve a well-defined plan."
ESFJ,"They tend to enjoy a career if it involves working with people on a regular basis, building relationships, and seeing people appreciate the service they provide. They like to apply their experience to practical work, give and receive appreciation, and see other people's relationships improve as well."

They enjoy building new relationships and working in an atmosphere of openness and trust. They like to give people new insights - helping them to develop and realise their potential."

They like to implement new strategies that improve quality, develop greater skills or competence, and enable the organisation to grow and develop."

They like to have variety, freedom and independence and working with groups in a fun, action-oriented environment."

They like working with intangibles, such as changing an organisational culture or uncovering new potential."
ENTP,"They tend to enjoy a career if it involves innovation and creativity, particularly if they have the opportunity to challenge the status quo. They enjoy debating issues in groups, breaking new ground, and working to high level objectives that require continuous improvement and quality/excellence."
ISTJ,"As an XXXX, your primary mode of living is focused internally, where you take things in via your five senses in a literal, concrete fashion. Your secondary mode is external, where you deal with things rationally and logically."
ISTJ,"They are quiet and reserved individuals who are interested in security and peaceful living. They have a strongly-felt internal sense of duty, which lends them a serious air and the motivation to follow through on tasks. Organized and methodical in their approach, they can generally succeed at any task which they undertake."
ISTJ,"They are very loyal, faithful, and dependable. They place great importance on honesty and integrity. They are 'good citizens' who can be depended on to do the right thing for their families and communities. While they generally take things very seriously, they also usually have an offbeat sense of humor and can be a lot of fun - especially at family or work-related gatherings."
ISTJ,"They tend to believe in laws and traditions, and expect the same from others. They're not comfortable with breaking laws or going against the rules. If they are able to see a good reason for stepping outside of the established mode of doing things, the XXXX will support that effort. However, They more often tend to believe that things should be done according to procedures and plans. If an XXXX has not developed their Intuitive side sufficiently, they may become overly obsessed with structure, and insist on doing everything 'by the book'."
ISTJ,"The XXXX is extremely dependable on following through with things which he or she has promised. For this reason, they sometimes get more and more work piled on them. Because the XXXX has such a strong sense of duty, they may have a difficult time saying 'no' when they are given more work than they can reasonably handle. For this reason, the XXXX often works long hours, and may be unwittingly taken advantage of."
ISTJ,"The XXXX will work for long periods of time and put tremendous amounts of energy into doing any task which they see as important to fulfilling a goal. However, they will resist putting energy into things which don't make sense to them, or for which they can't see a practical application. They prefer to work alone, but work well in teams when the situation demands it. They like to be accountable for their actions, and enjoy being in positions of authority. The XXXX has little use for theory or abstract thinking, unless the practical application is clear."
ISTJ,"They have tremendous respect for facts. They hold a tremendous store of facts within themselves, which they have gathered through their Sensing preference. They may have difficulty understanding a theory or idea which is different from their own perspective. However, if they are shown the importance or relevance of the idea to someone who they respect or care about, the idea becomes a fact, which the XXXX will internalize and support. Once the XXXX supports a cause or idea, he or she will stop at no lengths to ensure that they are doing their duty of giving support where support is needed."
ISTJ,"The XXXX is not naturally in tune with their own feelings and the feelings of others. They may have difficulty picking up on emotional needs immediately, as they are presented. Being perfectionists themselves, they have a tendency to take other people's efforts for granted, like they take their own efforts for granted. They need to remember to pat people on the back once in a while."
ISTJ,"They are likely to be uncomfortable expressing affection and emotion to others. However, their strong sense of duty and the ability to see what needs to be done in any situation usually allows them to overcome their natural reservations, and they are usually quite supporting and caring individuals with the people that they love. Once the XXXX realizes the emotional needs of those who are close to them, they put forth effort to meet those needs."
ISTJ,"The XXXX is extremely faithful and loyal. Traditional and family-minded, they will put forth great amounts of effort at making their homes and families running smoothly. They are responsible parents, taking their parenting roles seriously. They are usually good and generous providers to their families. They care deeply about those close to them, although they usually are not comfortable with expressing their love. The XXXX is likely to express their affection through actions, rather than through words."
ISTJ,"They have an excellent ability to take any task and define it, organize it, plan it, and implement it through to completion. They are very hard workers, who do not allow obstacles to get in the way of performing their duties. They do not usually give themselves enough credit for their achievements, seeing their accomplishments simply as the natural fulfillment of their obligations."
ISTJ,"They usually have a great sense of space and function, and artistic appreciation. Their homes are likely to be tastefully furnished and immaculately maintained. They are acutely aware of their senses, and want to be in surroundings which fit their need for structure, order, and beauty."
ISTJ,"Under stress, They may fall into 'catastrophe mode', where they see nothing but all of the possibilities of what could go wrong. They will berate themselves for things which they should have done differently, or duties which they failed to perform. They will lose their ability to see things calmly and reasonably, and will depress themselves with their visions of doom."
ISTJ,"In general, the XXXX has a tremendous amount of potential. Capable, logical, reasonable, and effective individuals with a deeply driven desire to promote security and peaceful living, the XXXX has what it takes to be highly effective at achieving their chosen goals - whatever they may be. . Value tradition, security, and peaceful living. Will work long and hard to fulfill duties. Can be depended on to follow through on tasks. Loyal and faithful. Stable, practical and down-to-earth. Family-minded. Dislike doing things that don't make sense to them. Dislike abstract theory, unless they see the practical application. Natural leaders. Prefer to work alone, but work well in teams when necessary. Extremely observant, they take in facts via their senses and store them internally. Vast, rich inner store of facts that they rely on to understand problems that they encounter in their lives. Profound respect for facts and concrete information. Make decisions objectively, applying logic and rational thinking. Dislike change, unless they are shown it's benefit in a concrete way. Have strong opinions about the way things should be done. Appreciate structured, orderly environments. Have very high standards for their own behavior and the behavior of others. Not naturally in-tune with other people's feelings. Able to accomplish almost anything if they put their minds to it. Community minded 'good citizens' "
ISTJ,"They have one character trait that puts them at a definite advantage in terms of career success - Perserverance. An XXXX can do almost anything that they have decided to do. However, there are areas in which they will function more happily and naturally. An XXXX will do best in a career in which they can use their excellent organizational skills and their powers of concentration to create order and structure. They seem to fit extremely well into the Management and Executive layer of the corporate business world."
ISTJ,"The following list of professions is built on our impression of careers that would be especially suitable for an XXXX. It is meant to be a starting place, rather than an exhaustive list. There are no guarantees that any or all of the careers listed here would be appropriate for you, or that your best career match is among those listed. . Business Executive. Administrator. Manager. Accountant. Financial Officer. Police Officer. Detective. Judge. Attorney. Medical Doctor. Dentist. Computer Programmer. Systems Analyst. Military Leader"
ISTJ,"The XXXX's word is as good as gold, and they honor their commitments faithfully. They believe that to do otherwise would be nothing less than a breach of honor and trustworthiness. Consequently, they take their vows very seriously, and once they have said 'I do', that means they are bound to the relationship until 'death do us apart' or otherwise. They are driven to fulfill their responsibilities and duties, and will do so with tireless effort. They will do their best to meet the obligations presented by the different relationship roles which they play during their lives, i.e. spouse, parent, offspring, etc. They may have difficulty showing warmth, but they frequently feel it in abundance, and most develop the ability to show it through sheer effort. If nothing else, the XXXX holds the gold medal of all the personality types for Effort. They will put forth tremendous amounts of effort to accomplish goals which are important to them. If healthy relationships are among these goals, you can bet that the XXXX will do everything that they can to foster and maintain healthy relationships.. Honor their commitments. Take their relationship roles very seriously. Usually able to communicate what's on their minds with precision. Good listeners. Extremely good (albeit conservative) with money. Able to take constructive criticism well. Able to tolerate conflict situations without emotional upheaval. Able to dole out punishment or criticism when called for . Tendency to believe that they're always right. Tendency to get involved in 'win-lose' conversations. Not naturally in-tune with what others are feeling. Their value for structure may seem rigid to others. Not likely to give enough praise or affirmation to their loved ones "
ISTJ,"They are committed, loyal partners, who will put forth tremendous amounts of effort into making their relationships work. Once they have made a commitment to a relationship, they will stick with it until the end. They gladly accept their duty towards fulfilling their role in the relationship. They are generally willing and able to do anything which they have defined as a goal. So, if maintaining a good relationship is important to the XXXX, they are likely to have a good relationship. If they have not added this goal to their internal 'list' of duties, they are likely to approach the relationship in their 'natural' state, which is extremely practical, traditional, and structured."
ISTJ,"Sexually, the XXXX is likely to approach intimacy from a physical perspective, rather than as a means of expressing love and affection. They usually have a problem expressing their deepest feelings, even though they may be very strongly felt. They will expect sex on a relatively scheduled basis, and are likely to honor traditions regarding gender role-playing. Male They will assert their perspective on their partners, while female They will tend to follow along with what their male counterparts want (although they will be uncomfortable with anything extremely out of the traditional norm)."
ISTJ,"They do not feel threatened by constructive criticism or conflict situations. When faced with criticism, the XXXX is likely to believe that their point of view is correct. They have a tremendous amount of respect for Facts, and base their opinions on known facts and logic. Consequently, they have a hard time seeing the viability of viewpoints which don't match their own. When the XXXX gets involved in a disagreement over a point, they usually begin to attempt to recruit the other person over to their own point of view, fully believing that they are right, and that the other individual simply needs to understand the facts of the situation. In such situations, the XXXX may or may not be right, but their confidence in their own 'rightness' can shake the confidence of others involved. This habit can quickly turn conversations into 'win-lose' situations, and can present a special problem in intimate relationships. While they may inadvertantly shake the confidence of their colleagues with their 'I'm right' approach, the same behavior may cause serious issues within their intimate relationships. The XXXX's constant assertion of 'rightness' may send a message to their mates that they do not value their opinions. If the XXXX has a mate with a strong Feeling preference, they may inadvertantly wreak havoc with their self-esteem, since Feeling individuals are extremely sensitive to conflict and criticism, and are especially vulnerable in their intimate relationships."
ISTJ,"Since They make decisions using the Thinking function (rather than Feeling), they are not naturally likely to consider their mates feelings and emotions in daily living. This may be a problem if their mates have the Feeling preference, since Feeling individuals usually expect a lot of positive affirmation, which the XXXX does not naturally communicate to them. The XXXX needs to remember that others may need to hear that they are loved and valued, even if the XXXX doesn't need to hear this themself."
ISTJ,"They are generally very capable and efficient at most things which they endeavor. Consequently, their mates are likely to hold a good amount of respect for them. Daily concerns are likely to be well-provided for by the XXXX. If other concerns, such as emotional needs, are pointed out to the XXXX as important issues for their mates, the XXXX will rise to the occasion and add the task of addressing these needs to the internal 'list' of duties. Since the XXXX is so willing to work hard at issues, and so tireless at performing tasks which they feel should be done, the XXXX generally makes a wonderful, caring mate who is willing and able to promote a healthy, lasting relationship which is also a partnership."
ISTJ,"They are faithful and devoted parents who can be counted on to put forth their very best efforts towards raising their children in positive, comfortable, secure homes, and to promote their growth in such a way that they will become secure adults who know their place in life within our society. Such is the greatest goal of an XXXX parent toward their child."
ISTJ,"Along the path towards this goal, the XXXX expects that their children honor their traditional familial roles. As parents, they demand respect and authority from their children. They willingly accept their parental role of provider and guardian. Once the XXXX becomes a parent, it becomes a 'given' that they will perform all of the duties associated with parenthood, and they will do so without grudge or burden. However, they expect that their children give them their due respect in return, and will have little patience with disrespectful behavior."
ISTJ,"When it comes to giving punishment or discipline, the XXXX will be able to do so when necessary without too much internal trauma. They see it as their duty to teach their children when they've done wrong, and so will administer the punishment in the name of the greater cause of doing their duty towards their children. Not to imply that the XXXX will enjoy disciplining their children, they simply will put their duties before their personal feelings."
ISTJ,"The XXXX is likely to have a problem giving a lot of positive affirmation and support to their children. Having very high expectations for their own behavior and the behavior of others, the XXXX often forgets to give praise when praise is due. All children need positive support as they find their place in the world, and this is especially true for children with the Feeling preference, who benefit tremendously from positive affirmation, and suffer (sometimes tremendously) in its void. The XXXX who recognizes sensitivity in their child should take special care to give them positive support and affirmation."
ISTJ,"The XXXX will create a consistent, secure environment for their children, with definite roles and boundaries. Although this may at times create division between the parent and child (especially during rebellious adolescence), it will generally promote the child's growth into a secure adult. XXXX parents will be remembered and honored by their children for being good people who always tried their best, and for putting the needs of their children above their own."
ISTJ,"Although friendships do not rank highest in the XXXX's list of important relationships (whose duties and obligation to the Family rank above all else), they do have value these relationships and put effort into enhancing and maintaining them. The XXXX is likely to choose to be around people who have similar interests and perspectives to their own, and are likely to not have much patience with people who are very different from themselves."
ISTJ,"Although their usual mode of being is very serious-minded, They like to have fun and let loose. They like being with Extraverts who are optimistic and fun-minded, although the E's enthusiasm may eventually get on the XXXX's nerves. They can get along with most other types, but they especially form solid connections with other Sensing Judgers. The XXXX's respect for laws and traditions may make them unable to relate well to Sensing Perceiving types, although they admire their carefree ability to live for the moment. And conversely, the Sensing Perceiving types may see the XXXX's need for structure as too conservative or scheduled for their tastes. They seem to get along well with Intuitives, although they cannot really relate to some of the Intuitives perspectives."
ISTJ,"People with the XXXX personality type are serious, methodical, analytical, and hard-working. They store knowledge gained from their experiences, and use this knowledge to tackle new problems and ideas. They will work a problem through to its identified conclusion. They work towards defined goals; their analytical objectivity gives them the tendency to make goal-oriented decisions that are not waylaid by the concerns of individuals. They're uncomfortable with ideas that are completely new to them, or that are totally theoretical in nature. Since they have no direct experience with the new concept, they have no tools for knowing how to deal with it or what to think about it. They need to get the framework for a new concept before they're able to deal with it. An experienced XXXX is usually a very capable person, and makes an excellent manager. They have great value for the 'tried and true' approach, and are reluctant to adopt new systems until direct experience proves the validity of the new system. They internalize and value the rules and structure of the society in which they live, and disapprove of behaviors that go against these rules. They highly value the cornerstone institutions of society such as Family, Work, and Church. Their hard-working, dedicated nature is especially well-suited for holding up such institutions. An XXXX's feeling of success depends upon being able to use their experience for the benefit of an institution, and also upon the level of structure and lack of chaos in their life, and in the health and welfare of their family or other social structure."
ISTJ,"Their desire to execute known systems against concrete facts makes them happy to chunk through large amounts of routine work. With their respect for rules and order, they value honesty and integrity and seek to live with these ideals. An XXXX has a 'stick to it' attitude. They're not afraid of hard work, and will put forth a great deal of effort towards something that they are interested in. This persistence will help the XXXX to achieve any identified goal. The XXXX's value for social structure makes them more interested in being social than is true for many Introverts."
ISTJ,"They will move beyond an expectation that others should follow rules into a dedication and willingness to work hard to uphold standards themselves. They show a dedication to maintaining personal relationships that lends them a respect for individual differences. They will use their inner store of facts for the benefit of an institution or society in general, rather than to satisfy their own interests. The more they develop their Xx, the better they will become at strategizing. They will be able to brainstorm multiple possible solutions to problems. They are often uncomfortable with decisions based on values rather than on objective criteria, but the more they develop their Xx, the more likely they will become able to use Xx as a positive force rather than strictly a negative one. This will allow them to understand a value judgement that is based on personal perspective rather than social obligation."
ISTJ,"Excessive love of food and drink. Lack of interest in other people, or in relating to them. Occasional inappropriate emotional displays. General selfish 'look after oneself' tendencies. Uses judgement to dismiss other's opinions and perspectives, before really understanding them. May judge others rather than themselves. May look at external ideas and people with the primary purpose of finding fault. May become slave to their routine and 'by the book' ways of doing things, to the point that any deviation is completely unacceptable. May have difficulty communicating their thoughts and feelings to anyone"
ISTJ,"Nearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be attributed in various degrees to the common XXXX problem of Xx overtaking the XXXX's personality to the point that all other functions become slaves to Xx. A more 'whole' personality needs to have a good balance between its dominant and auxiliary functions. For an XXXX, the dominant Xx needs to be well-supported by the auxiliary Xx function. If Xx exists only to support the desires of Xx, than neither function is being used to its potential."
ISTJ,"Xx is a personality function that constantly gathers data and stores it in a sort of informational database to be accessed at will in the future. As the dominant player in a personality, it has the effect of constantly bombarding the psyche with facts to store. As something new is perceived, it is added to the vast warehouse of Xx data. Xx does not in itself analyze this data for meaning or connection--it just takes it in as information. In order to sort through and make use of this information, a judging function must be applied. It is the judging function that does the analysis and ordering of the data."
ISTJ,"When Xx is too dominant, or Xx is not developed sufficiently, we see the XXXX using Xx to order the individual's world in such a way that Xx can reign without interference. This may include dismissing the importance of relationships, or pushing away anything that threatens the XXXX's highly introverted way of life. In this manner, Xx is used against the external world, rather than against the XXXX's internal data. It is a defensive shield, rather than a useful filter."
ISTJ,"The better, more 'whole' use of Xx for the XXXX would be to use it to order and evaluate its own rich store of data, and therefore generate useful solutions to problems and efficient systems. Like all types, most They will show some signs of this kind of weakness. This does not mean that they're hopelessly flawed. The real problems occur when an XXXX personality has become so imbalanced that its owner is extremely selfish and unable to consider the importance or validity of anyone else's perspective."
ISTJ,"To grow as an individual, the XXXX needs to focus on applying their judgement against information that they have gathered, rather than against single facts or ideas coming from others. Before judging, put all new data into the context of existing facts. Working with all of the facts at your disposal will greatly improve your ability to judge effectively, and will reduce the likelihood that you will become offensively reactionary and isolationist."
ISTJ,"An XXXX who is concerned with personal growth will pay close attention to the subject of ther judgments, and their motivations for making judgments. Are they judging something external to themself, or are they judging something within the context of their stored knowledge? Is the motivation for judging something to be able to understand its usefulness in the world, or to dismiss it? Too often, an XXXX will judge something without properly understanding it, and with the intention of dismissing it. Seek first to understand, then to judge."
ISTJ,"People of all personality types sometimes experience problems dealing with specific aspects of civilization and human interaction. For the XXXX, problems are generally associated with being unable to tolerate behaviors that go outside perceived norms, and with not putting forth effort to meet others' emotional needs. These problems stem from building up the importance of the XXXX's inner world and diminishing the importance of the external world. They who recognize that their knowledge and experience can be enriched by the synergy of other people's knowledge and experience will find that they can be committed to their internal worlds and still have satisfying relationships with others. The key to accomplishing this is development of their highest extraverted function, Xx."
ISTJ,"An XXXX who uses Xx to find fault externally rather than internally may become so strongly opinionated that they form rigid and unreasonable expectations of others. Their hyper-vigilant judgments about the rationality and competence of others may be a very effective way of keeping themselves at an emotional distance from others. This will preserve the sanctity of the XXXX's inner world and lifestyle, but will reduce a lot of valuable input, arrest the development of their social character, and stagnate the development of the XXXX's rich store of experiential data. In extreme cases the XXXX may find him or herself quite alone and lonely."
ISTJ,"More commonly, the XXXX will run into trouble when they try to order and structure the outer world, rather than their inner world. Trying to structure people into a predefined, acceptable system is problematic. The personality types who value the unique individual will be offended by the apparent lack of respect for their person, and people with personality types who follow social values will want to be honoring their own system, rather then being forced to follow yours. Many people experience being controlled or manipulated as a form of suppression, and resist it. Eventually, they may harbor serious resentment against the suppressor."
ESTJ,"As an XXXX, your primary mode of living is focused externally, where you deal with things rationally and logically. Your secondary mode is internal, where you take things in via your five senses in a literal, concrete fashion."
ESTJ,"They live in a world of facts and concrete needs. They live in the present, with their eye constantly scanning their personal environment to make sure that everything is running smoothly and systematically. They honor traditions and laws, and have a clear set of standards and beliefs. They expect the same of others, and have no patience or understanding of individuals who do not value these systems. They value competence and efficiency, and like to see quick results for their efforts."
ESTJ,"They are take-charge people. They have such a clear vision of the way that things should be, that they naturally step into leadership roles. They are self-confident and aggressive. They are extremely talented at devising systems and plans for action, and at being able to see what steps need to be taken to complete a specific task. They can sometimes be very demanding and critical, because they have such strongly held beliefs, and are likely to express themselves without reserve if they feel someone isn't meeting their standards. But at least their expressions can be taken at face-value, because the XXXX is extremely straight-forward and honest."
ESTJ,"The XXXX is usually a model citizen, and pillar of the community. He or she takes their commitments seriously, and follows their own standards of 'good citizenship' to the letter. XXXX enjoys interacting with people, and likes to have fun. They can be very boisterous and fun at social events, especially activities which are focused on the family, community, or work."
ESTJ,"The XXXX needs to watch out for the tendency to be too rigid, and to become overly detail-oriented. Since they put a lot of weight in their own beliefs, it's important that they remember to value other people's input and opinions. If they neglect their Feeling side, they may have a problem with fulfilling other's needs for intimacy, and may unknowingly hurt people's feelings by applying logic and reason to situations which demand more emotional sensitivity."
ESTJ,"When bogged down by stress, an XXXX often feels isolated from others. They feel as if they are misunderstood and undervalued, and that their efforts are taken for granted. Although normally the XXXX is very verbal and doesn't have any problem expressing themself, when under stress they have a hard time putting their feelings into words and communicating them to others."
ESTJ,"They value security and social order above all else, and feel obligated to do all that they can to enhance and promote these goals. They will mow the lawn, vote, join the PTA, attend home owners association meetings, and generally do anything that they can to promote personal and social security."
ESTJ,"The XXXX puts forth a lot of effort in almost everything that they do. They will do everything that they think should be done in their job, marriage, and community with a good amount of energy. He or she is conscientious, practical, realistic, and dependable. While the XXXX will dutifully do everything that is important to work towards a particular cause or goal, they might not naturally see or value the importance of goals which are outside of their practical scope. However, if the XXXX is able to see the relevance of such goals to practical concerns, you can bet that they'll put every effort into understanding them and incorporating them into their quest for clarity and security. . Natural leaders - they like to be in charge. Value security and tradition. Loyal. Hard-working and dependable. Athletic and wholesome. Have a clear set of standards and beliefs that they live by. No patience with incompetence or inefficiency. Excellent organizational abilities. Enjoy creating order and structure. Very thorough. Will follow projects through to completion. Straight-forward and honest. Driven to fulfill their duties "
ESTJ,"They have a lot of flexibility in the types of careers that they choose. They are good at a lot of different things, because they put forth a tremendous amount of effort towards doing things the right way. They will be happiest in leadership positions, however, because they have a natural drive to be in charge. They are best suited for jobs that require creating order and structure. . Military leader. Business Administrator. Manager. Athlete. Police Officer. Detective. Judge. Financial Officer. Teacher. Coach. Sales Representative"
ESTJ,"They are very enthusiastic people who are driven to fulfill their obligations and duties, especially those towards their families. Their priorities generally put God first, family second, and friends third. They put forth a tremendous amount of effort to meet their obligations and duties, according to their priorities. They are dedicated and committed to their relationships, which they consider to be lifelong and unalterable. They like to be in charge, and may be very controlling of their mates and children. They have high esteem for traditions and institutions, and expect that their mates and children will support these as well. They have little patience and need for dealing with people who see things very differently from the XXXX. . Generally enthusiastic, upbeat and friendly. Stable and dependable, they can be counted on to promote security for their families. Put forth a lot of effort to fulfill their duties and obligations. Responsible about taking care of day-to-day practical concerns around the house. Usually good (albeit conservative) with money. Not personally threatened by conflict or criticism. Interested in resolving conflict, rather than ignoring it. Take their commitments very seriously, and seek lifelong relationships. Able to move on after a relationship breaks up. Able to administer discipline when necessary . Tendency to believe that they are always right. Tendency to need to always be in charge. Impatient with inefficiency and sloppiness. Not naturally in tune with what others are feeling. Not naturally good at expressing their feelings and emotions. May inadvertantly hurt others with insensitive language. Tendency to be materialistic and status-conscious. Generally uncomfortable with change, and moving into new territories "
ESTJ,"When an XXXX says 'I do', you can bet that they will put forth a tremendous amount of effort and energy into fulfilling their commitment to the relationship. They seek stability and security in their lives, and once they have made a commitment, it is lifelong and unalterable. They bring with them into the relationship a strong and dependable nature, which is oriented in traditions and security. They are highly energetic people, who never seem to lose their energy when performing duties and fulfilling obligations."
ESTJ,"They usually feel very strongly that they are right and that if everyone else would listen carefully to what the XXXX has to say, then they would understand the way things really are, and the world would be a better place. Such a strong, confident self-image is an asset in many ways, but can also be a detriment in close interpersonal relationships, if the XXXX's mate does not feel valued for their contributions as an individual. This is a potential pitfall for They, who should try to be aware of the fact that other people have things to offer, even if they do not exactly follow the XXXX's way of thinking. If it's not possible to do this on a larger scale, the XXXX should perhaps focus on this area with respect to their partner's contributions."
ESTJ,"Sexually, the XXXX is likely to be robust, enthusiastic, and athletic. They will tend to be traditional, and to expect sexual encounters on a relatively scheduled basis. They're likely to approach intimacy as a physical experience of closeness, rather than as an opportunity to express and receive expressions of love and affection. The XXXX will probably have to work on remembering to express their feelings verbally, but their mate's appreciation will make it well worth it for those who do."
ESTJ,"In many ways, They are Guardians and Protectors by nature. They enjoy shielding and protecting their families, and are usually quite good at it. Their partners will appreciate and enjoy the benefits of the XXXX's efforts in this respect, but they may also resent the more controlling aspects of the XXXX's personality, which goes along with their strong desire to shield their loved-ones. The XXXX may consider it their duty to instruct their spouses how to behave or what attitude to take in certain situations, which may not be appreciated."
ESTJ,"Conversely, the XXXX freely gives approval and affirmation when they are happy or impressed with their mate's behavior. Whether positive or negative, the XXXX's expression can be taken at face value, because these individuals are very honest and forthright about how the feel."
ESTJ,"They enjoy spending time with others socializing, and are likely to strongly desire that their partners also take part in these social activities. They are especially interested in any event which is associated with the family, work, or any organization which the XXXX is part of. Since they are social creatures, they're likely to bring an emphasis on socializing to the relationship - but only after all of their work is done."
ESTJ,"They are not naturally in tune with what others are feeling, and they may even tend to be very unobservant in these respects. This can cause problems with mates who have a Feeling preference, who may feel hurt or neglected by the XXXX. If these feelings are pointed out to the XXXX as an important dynamic of the relationship, rather than harbored internally by the Feeler, the XXXX is likely to attempt to be more aware of their mate's feelings and emotions."
ESTJ,"The XXXX gladly performs their duties in life, and wants to be appreciated for doing so. This is the greatest gift that their mates can give them - gratitude."
ESTJ,"They take their parenting responsibilities seriously, and enjoy the roles and duties which they are consequently presented with. The XXXX sees parenthood as a natural state, and welcomes the opportunity to fulfill their basic obligation to pass on their genes, and to raise children to be responsible, independent adults."
ESTJ,"They usually expect that parents should be parents, and children should be children. There is likely to be that parent-child barrier between the XXXX and their kids, and they are likely to expect that their children will treat them with respect and honor. They will have no patience for extreme deviation from this basic rule."
ESTJ,"They also do not have much tolerance for inefficiency or messiness. They dislike to see mistakes repeated. Consequently, XXXX parents may have a difficult time with their children who have Intuitive or Perceiving preferences. They are extremely practical, and have no understanding or value for the creative imaginations of highly Intuitive children. They will also have little patience with the unstructured, 'go with the flow' attitude of their Perceiving children. This impatience with other types is a potential downfall for the XXXX which may manifest itself in an ugly way if the rift occurs with their own children. The XXXX should remember that what is right for them is not necessarily right for their children."
ESTJ,"Whatever difficulties an XXXX may experience with their child, they will always accept that child back as their own. They are strongly driven to fulfill their duties, and see parenting as one of these 'must do' obligations."
ESTJ,"Children of the XXXX will usually remember them as dependable, reliable, strict, traditional, and always willing to sacrifice themself for the sake of their children."
ESTJ,"Although They typically put their family above their friends, they do enjoy and value their friendships. They enjoy having fun and spending time with others, especially those who share their interests and pursuits. They are likely to choose to spend free time with friends pursuing some activity or hobby - probably athletic or sports-oriented. They're likely to socialize quite a bit with their own family members, and with people who belong to the same organization or institution as the XXXX."
ESTJ,"They are usually status-conscious, and will respect others who they feel have acheived a high degree of success in our society. Although They have very high standards for behavior, and believe that they know what is appropriate and best in any given situation, they're likely to be less controlling with those who they feel are powerful individuals."
ESTJ,"They will have little patience with people who seem frivolous or extremely untraditional. Conversely, those who live entirely in the current moment (Sensing Perceivers) may not appreciate the XXXX's strong judgments, which may seem overly traditional to them. They are likely to bond best with other XXXX, or with people of any type, if they share a common interest or goal."
ESTJ,"They tend to be enthusiastic, sharp, and witty. They like to hear good jokes, and enjoy telling them as well. They're valued by their friends for being dependable and upbeat, and easily engaged in various pursuits."
ESTJ,"The XXXX is generally very opinionated, and likes to appear authoritative and in charge. They may temper this tendency when around other They whom they value. Around other types, this tendency may cause them to be abrupt and direct, to the point where they inadvertantly step on people's toes."
ESTJ,"People with the XXXX personality type have a high value for social order and structure. Throughout his or her life, the XXXX develops a set of judgement standards that they use to order events and impressions that exist in the world. These standards are essentially social principles. The XXXX believes very strongly in their principles, and strongly disapproves of any violation. The XXXX believes that their principles define appropriate behavior and attitudes, and therefore should be followed unconditionally. Just as they naturally create rules, and are therefore natural leaders, They also believe in following existing social rules. They often lead, but can follow easily if they trust the authority of the system they're following. The XXXX can be quite harsh about the violation of a principle. It is more important to the XXXX that the principle is honored than that they consider the position or feelings of the individual who transgressed against the principle. Their harshness of manner may damage personal relationships, until the XXXX incorporates standards for behavior within personal relationships into their system of social rules. The XXXX truly enjoys being around other people, and wants to promote traditional relationships. An XXXX may feel successful if they are able to live their lives within their defined system of principles, but their true and lasting success will come from the ability to create and sustain good and lasting principles, and thus to address all situations in their life adequately and consistently."
ESTJ,"They believe strongly in doing their duty, and perform out of a sense of duty, rather than an expectation of getting something in return. They usually have a good memory. They're natural leaders. They are usually good strategists and 'game' players. They are generally law-abiding and hard working. They are Loyal -- to their family, friends, country, etc."
ESTJ,"They understand and create effective and fair principles that are unconditional, and in so doing, they perform a great social service. They may make outstanding Judges and Politicians. They live their life in a highly ethical and moral manner. They are great strategists, and may make great military commanders. They're able to create systems for behavior to meet all of the needs that they encounter in life. In such a way, they are satisfied because their world is organized in a principle-centric way that is effective and enduring."
ESTJ,"May be unaware or uncaring of how they come across to others. May deliberately bully people into behaving a certain way (with the justification that they're enforcing a principle.) May quickly dismiss input from others without really considering it. May have difficulty communicating their thoughts and feelings to others. Maybe have difficulty understanding the importance of considering people's feelings, and trying to meet their emotional needs. May hold grudges, and have difficulty forgiving people. May have an intense and quick temper. May be highly controlling towards others. May be unable to place value on individual life. May be unable to see the long-term impact of their behavior."
ESTJ,"Nearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be attributed to the common problem of Xx overtaking the XXXX personality to the point that all other personality functions exist only to serve Thinking's needs. A healthy and successful personality needs to have a good balance between its dominant and auxiliary functions. For an XXXX, dominant Xx needs to be well-supported by the auxiliary Xx function. If Xx exists only to support the agenda of Xx, then neither function is living up to its potential, and the subject XXXX is not reaching their potential in their job or their personal relationships."
ESTJ,"In the case where auxilary Sensing is underused, the XXXX will live entirely within the boundaries of their existing principles. They will hold up their own set of principles as an inalienable representation of the Right Thing To Do, and apply everything they encounter in life to this principle system. If they perceive behavior that does not fit into their set of principles, they will ruthlessly judge it and shut down any alternative view of the violation. In being so tied to their Xx process, they lose the ability to truly consider incoming information, and therefore lose the ability to synergize with other people and solve problems in an effective way. Perhaps most importantly, the XXXX loses the ability to connect with their own Self. They become out of touch with their own personal needs, and dissociated from their core Self. The net effect of these happenings is an XXXX leader who expects absolute adherence to his or her demands; who lacks the ability to see long-range implications associated with these demands; who is unwilling to consider alternate solutions or plans; and who is dissociated from any personal priorities or value system. Such a leader is unlikely to be effective and successful in their job or personal life, although are likely unaware of the reasons for their problems."
ESTJ,"It is quite common for people to allow their dominant function to overrule their personality. In the case of the Xx, allowing Thinking to dominate without counter-balance can have great impact on the social interactions of the XXXX. Female They may be viewed as overbearing, controlling, or masculine, and may not be as readily accepted by social standards. This may cause low self- esteem in the female XXXX. Male They are somewhat worse off, because social stereotypes may encourage them that they are entitled to be domineering. They may have no interest in growing beyond their limited outlook."
ESTJ,"Xx is a personality function that creates structure by identifying and adhering to logical principles. It is a social form of judgement, in that it is defined by the external world, rather than by an inner sense of right and wrong. The true strength of Xx is its highly ethical nature. It is not swayed by individual appeals -- it believes wholeheartedly in the merit of the Principle. If the Principle exists, then it should be followed. Once the Xx type has identified the principle, it is their business to enforce that principle. The Xx does not expect anything back for living by that principle. It expects that the principle should be respected without condition. In other words, the XXXX believes that you should do what's right because it is what's right, rather than doing what's right because you want something in return. In this ideal sense, Xx judgement is the cornerstone of laws and legal systems. Xx has much to offer our society, in its purety of intention."
ESTJ,"Xx, the auxiliary function of the XXXX, is the means of observing data and storing it for future reference. Xx is capable of considering and storing huge amounts of data. When this data is fed into the dominant Thinking function, the personality uses real data to form principles and enforce structure upon the world. In the case where the XXXX has an overly-dominant Thinking function, the importance of the auxilliary Sensing function is reduced. Data cannot be seen outside of its context within a principle. The XXXX will not be able to see beyond the fact that a principle has been violated. They will be unable to see the data objectively."
ESTJ,"An XXXX who is interested in coming into his or her own potential should consciously try to suspend judgement until all of the facts are known. An effective XXXX is not afraid to redefine principles when information cannot be understood or dealt with effectively within their known systems. Practicing this sort of behavior will help auxilary Introverted Sensation to flourish, and thereby allow the entire personality to become a more effective and positive force."
ESTJ,"For example, an XXXX friend recently told me that he was convinced that his mother's cleaning lady was a con-artist. I asked him why he thought so, and he said 'because she takes money and does absolutely nothing.' Apparently the house was not being cleaned to his standards. He believed that the cleaning lady was paid to do a certain job, and he expected that it would be completed to a certain standard for a certain fee. This was his principle. She violated that principle by not doing the job well enough. The fact that she took money for a job that she didn't do was nothing less than criminal behavior to him. When I asked him if the cleaning lady had been given directions on what specifically to clean, he said he didn't know, but that she was a cleaning lady so she should know what to do (another principle.) We soon discovered that the cleaning lady was paid about half the going rate for her job. When I explored this situation a bit futher (out of concern for my friend's mother) I discovered that the cleaning lady had almost no guidance on what to clean, but that she was busy the entire time that she hired, and that she was perhaps not the cleanest of cleaning ladies. When she was given more direction, she performed to a better standard. My assertion that the cleaning lady kept busy the whole time that she was hired was flatly rejected by my XXXX friend. He would not consider that piece of information, nor would he consider the fact that she was paid much less than the standard rate for cleaning ladies. Within his principle system, she was a con-artist, and he did not consider data that might offer an alternate explanation."
ESTJ,"Rather than simply rejecting the new information that became available, my XXXX friend could have altered his principles slightly to allow for differences in personal capabilities and results amongst individuals, and to allow for the fact that the cleaning lady getting a lower rate of pay did offset the lower quality of service at some level. Using the new data (made available by Xx) to tweak and redefine his principles would allow him to create a more effective system of principles that would be better able to handle similar future challenges."
ESTJ,"In general, developing Xx is the XXXX's key to optimizing the effectiveness and resiliency of their principles. It will also improve their general balance of character, and therefore open the door to growth within other aspects of their psyche."
ESTJ,"Some They have difficulty fitting into our society. Their problems are often associated with being controlling of others, having unreasonable expectations for others' behaviors, failing to consider others' needs and ideas, and generally coming across too strongly. These issues stem primarily from the common XXXX habit of using Xx in a mode in which it quickly and automatically applies existing principles against the external world, rather than taking the time to weigh their inner data against their principles for behavior. They need to be able to use their rich store of internal data to feed their principles. Insisting on adherence to steadfast principles while ignoring factual information is a recipe for trouble, such as we have seen with various dictatorships throughout history. In order to flourish in a healthy way, the XXXX has to recognize the importance of their inner data stores, and needs to use all available data to form good principles. In order to accomplish this, the XXXX needs to recognize the importance of Introversion, and develop the use of their highest introverted function, Xx."
ISFJ,"As an XXXX, your primary mode of living is focused internally, where you takes things in via your five senses in a literal, concrete fashion. Your secondary mode is external, where you deal with things according to how you feel about them, or how they fit into your personal value system."
ISFJ,"They live in a world that is concrete and kind. They are truly warm and kind-hearted, and want to believe the best of people. They value harmony and cooperation, and are likely to be very sensitive to other people's feelings. People value the XXXX for their consideration and awareness, and their ability to bring out the best in others by their firm desire to believe the best."
ISFJ,"They have a rich inner world that is not usually obvious to observers. They constantly take in information about people and situations that is personally important to them, and store it away. This tremendous store of information is usually startlingly accurate, because the XXXX has an exceptional memory about things that are important to their value systems. It would not be uncommon for the XXXX to remember a particular facial expression or conversation in precise detail years after the event occured, if the situation made an impression on the XXXX."
ISFJ,"They have a very clear idea of the way things should be, which they strive to attain. They value security and kindness, and respect traditions and laws. They tend to believe that existing systems are there because they work. Therefore, they're not likely to buy into doing things in a new way, unless they're shown in a concrete way why its better than the established method."
ISFJ,"They learn best by doing, rather than by reading about something in a book, or applying theory. For this reason, they are not likely to be found in fields which require a lot of conceptual analysis or theory. They value practical application. Traditional methods of higher education, which require a lot of theorizing and abstraction, are likely to be a chore for the XXXX. The XXXX learns a task best by being shown its practical application. Once the task is learned, and its practical importance is understood, the XXXX will faithfully and tirelessly carry through the task to completion. The XXXX is extremely dependable."
ISFJ,"The XXXX has an extremely well-developed sense of space, function, and aesthetic appeal. For that reason, they're likely to have beautifully furnished, functional homes. They make extremely good interior decorators. This special ability, combined with their sensitivity to other's feelings and desires, makes them very likely to be great gift-givers - finding the right gift which will be truly appreciated by the recipient."
ISFJ,"More so than other types, They are extremely aware of their own internal feelings, as well as other people's feelings. They do not usually express their own feelings, keeping things inside. If they are negative feelings, they may build up inside the XXXX until they turn into firm judgments against individuals which are difficult to unseed, once set. Many They learn to express themselves, and find outlets for their powerful emotions."
ISFJ,"Just as the XXXX is not likely to express their feelings, they are also not likely to let on that they know how others are feeling. However, they will speak up when they feel another individual really needs help, and in such cases they can truly help others become aware of their feelings."
ISFJ,"The XXXX feels a strong sense of responsibility and duty. They take their responsibilities very seriously, and can be counted on to follow through. For this reason, people naturally tend to rely on them. The XXXX has a difficult time saying 'no' when asked to do something, and may become over-burdened. In such cases, the XXXX does not usually express their difficulties to others, because they intensely dislike conflict, and because they tend to place other people's needs over their own. The XXXX needs to learn to identify, value, and express their own needs, if they wish to avoid becoming over-worked and taken for granted."
ISFJ,"They need positive feedback from others. In the absence of positive feedback, or in the face of criticism, the XXXX gets discouraged, and may even become depressed. When down on themselves or under great stress, the XXXX begins to imagine all of the things that might go critically wrong in their life. They have strong feelings of inadequacy, and become convinced that 'everything is all wrong', or 'I can't do anything right'."
ISFJ,"The XXXX is warm, generous, and dependable. They have many special gifts to offer, in their sensitivity to others, and their strong ability to keep things running smoothly. They need to remember to not be overly critical of themselves, and to give themselves some of the warmth and love which they freely dispense to others. . Large, rich inner store of information that they have gathered. Highly observant and aware of people's feelings and reactions. Excellent memory for details that are important to them. Very in-tune with their surroundings - excellent sense of space and function. Can be depended on to follow things through to completion. Will work long and hard to see that jobs get done. Stable, practical, down-to-earth. Dislike working with theory and abstract thought. Dislike doing things that don't make sense to them. Value security, tradition, and peaceful living. Service-oriented: focused on what people need and want. Kind and considerate. Likely to put others' needs above their own. Learn best with hands-on training. Enjoy creating structure and order. Take their responsibilities seriously. Extremely uncomfortable with conflict and confrontation "
ISFJ,"They have two basic traits that help define their best career direction: 1) they are extremely interested and in-tune with how other people are feeling, and 2) they enjoy creating structure and order, and are extremely good at it. Ideally, the XXXX will choose a career in which they can use their exceptional people-observation skills to determine what people want or need, and then use their excellent organizational abilities to create a structured plan or environment for achieving what people want. Their excellent sense of space and function combined with their awareness of aesthetic quality also gives them quite special abilities in the more practical artistic endeavors, such as interior decorating and clothes design. . Interior Decorator. Designer. Firefighter. Nurse. Business Manager. Office Manager. Administrative Assistant. Child Care Provider. Social Worker. Counselor. Paralegal. Pastor or Priest. Church Employee. Shopkeeper. Bookkeeper. Forest Ranger"
ISFJ,"They place a great deal of importance on their personal relationships. They're generally very giving and loving people, who place the needs of others above their own. They sometimes have a problem with becoming overly emotionally needy, and with keeping their true feelings hidden from others. They take their commitments very seriously, and seek lifelong relationships. They are extremely dependable, and put forth a lot of energy into keeping things running smoothly. They sometimes have difficulty saying 'no' when asked to do something, and therefore may be taken for granted. . Warm, friendly and affirming by nature. Service-oriented, wanting to please others. Good listeners. Will put forth lots of effort to fulfill their duties and obligations. Excellent organizational capabilities. Good at taking care of practical matters and daily needs. Usually good (albeit conservative) at handling money. Take their commitments seriously, and seek lifelong relationships . Don't pay enough attention to their own needs. May have difficulty branching out into new territory. Extreme dislike of conflict and criticism. Unlikely to express their needs, which may cause pent-up frustrations to build inside. Have difficulty leaving a bad relationship. Have difficulty moving on after the end of a relationship "
ISFJ,"They are committed to their relationships. They have very intense feelings, which is not immediately apparent to others because they tend to hold things inside themselves without expressing them, unless they have a strong reason to do so. Their intensity of feeling makes their intimate relationship their first priority in life, with the possible exception of God. They seek monogamous, lifelong commitments, and can be depended upon to be faithful and loyal to their mates once they have made a commitment."
ISFJ,"They have a difficult time leaving a relationship which is bad, or accepting that a relationship is over. They tend to put all of the blame on their own shoulders, and wonder what they should have done to make things work out. If they have been loyal to their vows and have done their duties, they will be at a complete loss as to what went wrong, and will have great difficulty accepting the end. They are 'true blue' lovers, and may even remain faithful to their deceased partners."
ISFJ,"They tend to be very selfless, and to put the needs of others well before their own needs. This may backfire on them, if they get into a situation in which they are taken advantage of, and do not have a good outlet for their strong emotions. In this kind of situation, the XXXX might bottle up their feelings inside them, and form strong resentments against others. The XXXX should work on recognizing their own needs, and place some importance on meeting them, rather than always putting the needs of others first. After all, if you can't take care of yourself, how can take care of someone else?"
ISFJ,"Sexually, the XXXX sees intimacy as a tangible way of strengthening their relationship bonds. They also see as something of a duty, and are likely to be more interested in serving their partner than in their own personal satisfaction. Although the XXXX is not likely to be very wordy about expressing their love and affection, they're likely to do so through their deeds, and will deeply value their partner's responding affirmations."
ISFJ,"The XXXX is very warm and selfless. They'll put forth tremendous amounts of energy and time into doing what they feel is ther duty. What makes them feel best about themselves is when others show them their appreciation of the XXXX. Consequently, the best gift that the partner of an XXXX can give them is the expression of their love and appreciation."
ISFJ,"They have difficulty with conflict situations, and would much prefer to just sweep things under the rug. Sometimes facing a conflict situation helps to resolve it, and the XXXX should realize that the world will not end if they face the conflict, and express how they feel about it. A conflict situation is not necessarily a 'problem' which needs to be gotten rid of, and it is also not necessarily the XXXX's fault. It's a common problem for XXXX's to not express their feelings until pushed to some limit, after which they explode in anger and say things which they later feel they shouldn't have said. These kinds of outbursts can be reduced by expressing their feelings on a more regular basis, rather than keeping them pent up inside."
ISFJ,"In general, the XXXX is usually a traditional, family-minded individual who places the comfort of their mates and families as their first priority in life. They're great for providing for everyday basic needs, and have a depth of caring which is very unusual, and not found in most types. They highly invested in the health of their relationships, and will work very hard to make things run smoothly. They are dependable and affectionate lovers."
ISFJ,"Parenthood is seen as natural state and duty to the XXXX. They are responsible about ensuring that their children have their practical needs met, and try to teach them the rules and observations of our society so that they grow into responsible and independent adults."
ISFJ,"They may have difficulty administering punishment or discipline to their chldren, although most are able to overcome this discomfort because they feel it is their greater duty to instill their children with sound values. As individuals who value order and structure, they're likely to create well-defined boundaries and roles for their children to live within."
ISFJ,"XXXX parents have a very difficult time if their children grow into 'problem' adults They tend to believe that it is their responsibility, and that they didn't work hard enough to raise their children well. This may or may not be the case, but usually it isn't. The XXXX usually puts forth a lot of energy and effort, and doesn't give themselves credit for doing so."
ISFJ,"In many ways, an XXXX makes an ideal parent. Their children will not lack for structure, appropriate guidelines, or warmth and affection. Their children will remember and value the XXXX parent for their warm natures and genuine efforts on their children's behalf."
ISFJ,"Although the XXXX is likely to place God and family above their friends in their priorities, they genuinely enjoy spending time with friends and colleagues. In fact, They usually feel a strong need to talk problems and issues over with people before making decisions on their actions. Some They like to discuss things over with their friends, rather than their families."
ISFJ,"They enjoy spending time with most other types of people. The love to observe people's reactions and emotions in situations, and so enjoy being around diverse types of people. The XXXX usually remains reserved around others, and does not open up very much. However, since they have a need to talk things over with others in order to make decisions, they do really need some close confidantes in their life. Their preference for these companions are other Sensing Feeling Judgers. They really enjoy and respect the company of Intuitive Feelers as well, but are not able to relate to them quite as well."
ISFJ,"Friends of the XXXX will value them for their warmth, dependability, depth of emotional awareness and understanding."
ISFJ,"They are the homemakers, carers and facilitators of the world. Their strong sense of duty, hard-working tendencies and ability to respond quickly to what is suitable to a particular situation are great assets. With a dominant function that quickly grasps the qualities inherent within the external world, and a secondary function that weighs such perceptions against their value within this world, the XXXX has a great talent for discovering the aesthetic and essential qualities compatible with and relevant to a particular real world situation. This means that, not only within the world of objects, but also in their relationships with people, They are gifted with the ability to recognize and understand the comfort and surroundings suitable to a secure and pleasing existence. And they can do this with a decisiveness which might make others wonder if the XXXX was not in fact getting their answers from some form of intuitive understanding rather than what is really a vast library of carefully related memory images and value judgments. An XXXX will always feel best when their world a place of quality and reassurance, both for themselves and others. Success for an XXXX means being able to fulfil a role providing value for others and ordering their world in a way in which safety and security is balanced against a genuine respect for the aesthetic and positive qualities of life."
ISFJ,"You are adept at seeing the right balance, the best way to make the world look and feel good. This talent enables you to make your world reflect your inner self and become a place of security and growth in which others can feel at ease too. You have a gift for knowing what will make another person feel better about the world and themselves. Your valuable input to their world comes back to you in ways which aid your own personal development. You see clearly what is right and wrong, what grates on yourself and others, what works for harmony and what does not. Your clear recognition of these things gains you the confidence and respect of others. You have a great memory for things, places and events, their curious details and the relationships between them. More than this, you also remember what was both good and bad about these things. These skills show in your ability to give no nonsense advice and aid to others. Within yourself you know, even if others do not realise it, that for as long as they are trying to do their best, you will hold the line with them to the very end. You see this as simply doing the right thing, but in fact it is a special virtue and makes you one of the most worthy of partners and friends when the chips are down. You work hard to get the job done, and you can be counted on the stay with it till it is finished."
ISFJ,"Work is never a chore to you, but a gift you offer to the world. In your relationships you are able to clearly show others how you feel about them. Others will always feel at ease in your home and presence. Your efforts always seem to be appreciated by those around you. You will try to find pleasing ways to settle differences and to find the most satisfying solutions to both your own and others' difficulties. More often than not, you will know exactly the right thing to do, say, buy or create to make things better or move things toward a valid human solution to a problem. You will clearly see the conditions underlying a situation and their effects on the persons within it, enabling you to see ways of changing things for the better. In this sense, you may be a powerful agent for social justice."
ISFJ,"They are kind, steady and responsible beings with many special gifts. I would like for the XXXX to keep in mind some of the many positive things associated with being an XXXX as they read some of this more negative material. Also remember that the weaknesses associated with being an XXXX are natural to your type. Although it may be depressing to read about your type's weaknesses, please remember that we offer this information to enact positive change. We want people to grow into their own potential, and to live happy and successful lives."
ISFJ,"Many of the weaker characteristics that are found in They are due to their dominant and Xx function overshadowing the rest of their personality. This generally results in two notable effects: their Xx function is unable to balance their sharply rendered inner perceptions with a sense of human value, whilst at the same time these very perceptions often hint at strange associations and consequences which seem always to hover darkly in the background of the world"
ISFJ,"May find difficulty expressing their feelings without fear or anger. May be unable to correctly judge what really is for the best May wrongly suspect others of having hidden motives or agendas May be unable to shrug off feelings impending disaster May be unable to acknowledge or hear anything that goes against their certainty about the 'correct' or 'right' way to do things May have a tendency to blame particular persons for disturbing or upsetting 'their world' by simply being who they are May come across to others as cold and insensitive to anything but another's ability to fit in with and support their own judgments May be unnecessarily harsh or strict about appropriate social behaviour May be oblivious to what others think about them May come across as rigid, inflexible or even cold and uncaring to others, without being aware of it May be unable to understand verbal logic, and quickly cut off other's explanations May value their own certainties about the world and its problems far above others May be quite falsely certain of their influence upon, and understandingof others May be extremely vulnerable to tricks, con men, false hopes, religious cults and conspiracy theories May react with anger or distress when someone expresses disagreement with their view of the world, or disapproval of their judgements May favour their judgements to the degree that they are unable to notice the pain or difficulty such judgements might cause others Under great stress, are likely to make outrageously harsh and uncaringly selfish survival oriented decisions"
ISFJ,"Nearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be attributed in various degrees to the They internally mapped and abstract view of the world not being successfully coupled to an appropriate level of Extroverted feeling. Without this rational external balance, the They opposing unconscious functions can wreak havoc upon the order and sense of the They perceptions and ideas. They are usually stable, certain, reliable and deft in their approach to life. But if unbalanced, they are likely to treat any point of view other than their own with a kind of cold dismay, and if pressed hard will tend to shut out the existence of problems caused by others differing attitudes and opinions. If the XXXX does not learn how to deal with the wide range of differing world views they come into contact with, they can find themselves closed into a lonely little corner of the world in which only their own feelings of safety and certainty are maintained. This is a natural survival technique for the extreme XXXX personality."
ISFJ,"The main driver to the XXXX personality is Xx, whose function is to define the properties of and locate and recognise the sometimes abstract and innate qualities of and between the objects of the outer world. If an XXXX's picture of the world is threatened by external influences, the XXXX generally tries to shut such new information out of their lives. This is totally natural, and works well to protect the individual psyche from getting hurt. However, the XXXX who exercises this type of self-protection regularly will become closed within a small and ever decreasing circle of those family and friends who do not actively disturb their increasingly narrow and rigid world view. They will always find justification for their own inappropriate behaviours, and will always find fault with the outside world for problems that they have in their lives. It will be difficult for them to maintain close personal relationships because they will have a negatively polarised and therefore limited ability to communicate outside of the box of their own security needs."
ISFJ,"It is not an uncommon tendency for the XXXX to support their ideas and values by using only the value judgements they make about the world and other peoples behaviour. However, if this tendency is given free reign, the resulting XXXX personality is too self-centred to be happy or successful. Since the XXXX's dominant function is Xx, they must balance this with an auxiliary Xx function. If the XXXX uses Xx only to serve the purposes of Xx, then the XXXX is not using Extraversion effectively at all. As a result, the XXXX does not sufficiently recognise and sympathise with the way feelings effect the behaviour of others in the world to have a good sense of why things happen as they do. They see nothing but their own perspective, and deal with the world only so far as they need to in order to support their perspective. These individuals usually come across as somewhat judgemental and full of fixed and often rather ambiguously polarised ideas about the world. Other people are often surprised by the vehemence of their ideas and are usually unable to understand how they came by them."
ISFJ,"To grow as an individual, the XXXX needs to focus on opening their perspective to include a more accurate picture of the feelings and value judgements of others. In order to be in a position in which the XXXX is able to perceive and consider data that is foreign to their internal value system, the XXXX needs to recognise that their world view is not threatened by the new information. The XXXX must consciously tell himself/herself that emotional affects in others are not unrelated to reality; that the feelings of others are also just and valid within a wider and less rigorous vision of the world."
ISFJ,"The XXXX who is concerned with personal growth will pay close attention to their motivation for deciding what is good and bad, right and wrong. Do they try to find the feeling values of others in a situation? Or, do they value only those feelings which support a personal idea or cause? At the moment when something is felt, is the XXXX only concerned with whether that feeling supports something they recognise as correct? Or is she/he concerned with becoming truly empathetic? To achieve a better understanding of others and the world in which they live, the XXXX should try to put themselves into the minds of others, to locate and recognise how they have come to feel the way they do, before making judgements. They should consciously be aware of their tendency to discard anything that doesn't agree with their carefully ordered concepts, and work towards lessening this tendency. They should try to feel the way others would feel in situations, without making personal judgments about the actual situations. In general, they should work on exercising their Feeling in a truly extraverted sense. In other words, they should use Feeling to locate the their true connections to and relationship with others for the sake of gaining a wider perspective, rather than only allowing such feeling values to support their own conclusions. The XXXX who successfully feels things objectively may be quite a powerful force for positive change."
ISFJ,"Some They have difficulty fitting into our society. Their problems are often a result of an inability to flow with what is, a too negative or correcting attitude which dismays others, or unrealistic ideals and ideas about the world. These issues mostly stem from using Xx in a diminished manner: the lack of a strong externally focused value system allowing an often ambiguous and yet strongly defended world view which has little relation to concrete reality to control the personality. An XXXX who attempts to feel and value the feelings of others for the sake of understanding the world around them, rather than quickly deciding how they and they alone feel, will have a clearer, more objective understanding of how society is dependant not only upon structure and correct behaviour, but also how human values make it just what it is and not something else perhaps more desirable. He or she will also be more comfortable and less likely to demand that the world and the behaviour of others conform to some abstract code of being. Such well-adjusted They will fit happily into our society."
ESFJ,"As an XXXX, your primary mode of living is focused externally, where you deal with things according to how you feel about them, or how they fit in with your personal value system. Your secondary mode is internal, where you take things in via your five senses in a literal, concrete fashion."
ESFJ,"They are people persons - they love people. They are warmly interested in others. They use their Sensing and Judging characteristics to gather specific, detailed information about others, and turn this information into supportive judgments. They want to like people, and have a special skill at bringing out the best in others. They are extremely good at reading others, and understanding their point of view. The XXXX's strong desire to be liked and for everything to be pleasant makes them highly supportive of others. People like to be around They, because the XXXX has a special gift of invariably making people feel good about themselves."
ESFJ,"The XXXX takes their responsibilities very seriously, and is very dependable. They value security and stability, and have a strong focus on the details of life. They see before others do what needs to be done, and do whatever it takes to make sure that it gets done. They enjoy these types of tasks, and are extremely good at them."
ESFJ,"They are warm and energetic. They need approval from others to feel good about themselves. They are hurt by indifference and don't understand unkindness. They are very giving people, who get a lot of their personal satisfaction from the happiness of others. They want to be appreciated for who they are, and what they give. They're very sensitive to others, and freely give practical care. They are such caring individuals, that they sometimes have a hard time seeing or accepting a difficult truth about someone they care about."
ESFJ,"With Xx dominating their personality, They are focused on reading other people. They have a strong need to be liked, and to be in control. They are extremely good at reading others, and often change their own manner to be more pleasing to whoever they're with at the moment."
ESFJ,"The XXXX's value system is defined externally. They usually have very well-formed ideas about the way things should be, and are not shy about expressing these opinions. However, they weigh their values and morals against the world around them, rather than against an internal value system. They may have a strong moral code, but it is defined by the community that they live in, rather than by any strongly felt internal values."
ESFJ,"They who have had the benefit of being raised and surrounded by a strong value system that is ethical and centered around genuine goodness will most likely be the kindest, most generous souls who will gladly give you the shirt off of their back without a second thought. For these individuals, the selfless quality of their personality type is genuine and pure. They who have not had the advantage of developing their own values by weighing them against a good external value system may develop very questionable values. In such cases, the XXXX most often genuinely believes in the integrity of their skewed value system. They have no internal understanding of values to set them straight. In weighing their values against our society, they find plenty of support for whatever moral transgression they wish to justify. This type of XXXX is a dangerous person indeed. Xx drives them to control and manipulate, and their lack of Intuition prevents them from seeing the big picture. They're usually quite popular and good with people, and good at manipulating them. Unlike their XXXX cousin, they don't have Intuition to help them understand the real consequences of their actions. They are driven to manipulate other to achieve their own ends, yet they believe that they are following a solid moral code of conduct."
ESFJ,"All They have a natural tendency to want to control their environment. Their dominant function demands structure and organization, and seeks closure. They are most comfortable with structured environments. They're not likely to enjoy having to do things which involve abstract, theoretical concepts, or impersonal analysis. They do enjoy creating order and structure, and are very good at tasks which require these kinds of skills. They should be careful about controling people in their lives who do not wish to be controlled."
ESFJ,"They respect and believe in the laws and rules of authority, and believe that others should do so as well. They're traditional, and prefer to do things in the established way, rather than venturing into unchartered territory. Their need for security drives their ready acceptance and adherence to the policies of the established system. This tendency may cause them to sometimes blindly accept rules without questioning or understanding them."
ESFJ,"An XXXX who has developed in a less than ideal way may be prone to being quite insecure, and focus all of their attention on pleasing others. He or she might also be very controling, or overly sensitive, imagining bad intentions when there weren't any."
ESFJ,"They incorporate many of the traits that are associated with women in our society. However, male They will usually not appear feminine at all. On the contrary, They are typically quite conscious about gender roles and will be most comfortable playing a role that suits their gender in our society. Male They will be quite masculine (albeit sensitive when you get to know them), and female They will be very feminine."
ESFJ,"They at their best are warm, sympathetic, helpful, cooperative, tactful, down-to-earth, practical, thorough, consistent, organized, enthusiastic, and energetic. They enjoy tradition and security, and will seek stable lives that are rich in contact with friends and family. . Organized. Loyal. Can be depended on to follow things through to completion. Enjoy creating order, structure and schedules. Enjoy interacting with people. Warm-hearted and sympathetic. Tend to put others' needs above their own. Very good at giving practical care. Very cooperative, good team members. Practical and down-to-earth. Value peaceful living and security. Enjoy variety, but work well with routine tasks. Need approval from others. Receive satisfaction from giving to others. Live in the here and now - dislike theorizing about the future "
ESFJ,"The XXXX has two primary traits that will help define their best career direction: 1) they are extremely organized and enjoy creating order, and 2) much of their self-satisfaction is gotten through giving and helping others. Accordingly, they will do well at tasks that involve creating or maintaining order and structure, and they will be happiest when they are serving others. . Nurse. Teacher. Administrator. Child Care. Physician. Clergy. Office Manager. Counselor. Social Worker. Bookkeeper. Accountant. Administrative Assistant"
ESFJ,"They are warm-hearted individuals who highly value their close personal relationships. They are very service-oriented, and their own happiness is closely tied into the happiness and comfort of those around them. They are valued for their genuine warm and caring natures, and their special ability to bring out the best in others. They usually do not handle conflict well, and may tend to be very controlling or manipulative. Relationships are central to their lives, and they put forth a great amount of energy into developing and maintaining their close interpersonal relationships. They expect the same from others. . Put forth a lot of effort to fulfill their duties and obligations. Warm, friendly and affirming by nature. Service-oriented, they want to please others. Take their commitments very seriously, and seek lifelong relationships. Responsible and practical, they can be counted to take care of day-to-day necessities. Generally upbeat and popular, people are drawn towards them. Generally very good money managers. Traditionally minded and family-oriented, they will make family celebrations and traditions special events . Generally uncomfortable with change, and moving into new territories. Extreme dislike of conflict and criticism. Need a lot of positive affirmation to feel good about themselves. May be overly status-conscious, and interested in how others see them. Have very difficult time accepting the end of a relationship, and are likely to take the blame for the failure onto their own shoulders. Have difficulty accepting negative things about people close to them. Don't pay enough attention to their own needs, and may be self-sacrificing. May tend to use guilt manipulation as a way to get what they want "
ESFJ,"They are warmly caring people who give their intimate relationships a lot of special care and attention. They're usually traditional and take their commitments very seriously. Once the XXXX has said 'I do', you can bet that they will put forth every effort to fulfill their obligations to the relationship."
ESFJ,"They want to be appreciated for who they are, and what they give to others. This need of theirs is sometimes intensified to the point where they are very emotionally needy, and constantly 'go fishing' for affirmation if it is not freely given. They typically cannot stand conflict or criticism. They take any sort of criticism as a general indictment of their character. This is a potential pitfall for They to be aware of. In the face of negative feedback, or the absence of positive affirmation, XXXX may become very depressed and down on themselves. Appreciation is the greatest gift that their mates can give them."
ESFJ,"They have a tendency to be very conscious of social status and 'what other people think'. They should take care not to let this interfere with their close relationships."
ESFJ,"Sexually, They are warm and loving, and welcome intimacy as an opportunity to express their affections, and receive their partners gifts of love. Many They have a tendency to be highly scheduled and traditional in their sexual habits, but this is almost always overcome by increasing their education and awareness of options. They are very service-oriented and will place a lot of importance on making their partners happy."
ESFJ,"Being highly practical, the XXXX is excellent in matters regarding home management. They're likely to be very responsible about taking care of day-to-day needs, and to be careful and cautious about money matters. They are interested in security and peaceful living, and are willing and able to do their part towards acheiving these goals for themselves, their mates, and their families."
ESFJ,"Most They have a strong need to 'belong' - whether it be to institutions or traditions, or family units. This need usually causes them to be quite social creatures, who enjoy attending parties, as well as throwing their own. They're likely to strongly desire that their mates share in their social experiences."
ESFJ,"As parents, They are extremely committed to their roles and duties, and contain and freely express a great deal of love and affection for their children. They expect their children to honor, respect and obey their parents, and do not tolerate well any deviance from this rule of behavior. Their Feeling preference makes it difficult for them to punish or discipline their children. If they have not worked on overcoming this issue, they may tend to punish their children in less obvious ways, such as using guilt manipulation. This is a potential pitfall for the XXXX to overcome. It is generally more effective and more healthy to directly issue punishment when called for."
ESFJ,"The XXXX is very service-oriented and concerned with the comfort and happiness of those around them. Consequently, their children are likely to have their practical needs taken care of very efficiently and responsibly. Their XXXX parents will create structured environments for the children, where their boundaries will be well-defined and known."
ESFJ,"The XXXX's tendency to be controlling, combined with their emphasis on tradition and security, makes it likely that they will be at least somewhat strict and controlling of their children. However, they will also be their children's strongest, loudest advocate. Children of XXXX parents are likely to rebel from their authority at some point, which will cause a stressful time for both parent and child. In this case, the XXXX natural tendency is to make their children feel guilty about their behavior. Depending on the extent of the guilt manipulation, this may cause serious damage to the relationship."
ESFJ,"Most They are remembered fondly by their children for their genuine love and affection, and for the well-defined structure and guidelines they created for their children."
ESFJ,"Although the XXXX usually puts their family in front of their friends, they do place a lot of importance on their close friendships, and feel tremendous loyalty towards their friends. Since they feel tremendous pressure in their lives to constantly 'do their duty', they may sometimes turn their friendships into another task or responsibility. Usually, however, they get a lot of enjoyment from their friendships, and give back a lot of affirming warmth."
ESFJ,"There are a couple of XXXX tendencies which may cause problems with their casual and intimate friendships: 1) they don't give things freely - they expect something in return, and 2) they have a difficult time believing anything bad about someone close to them."
ESFJ,"They are valued by others for their genuine interest in people, and for their warmth and kind-heartedness. They have a special skill at seeing the best in others, and making people feel good about themselves. As such, they usually have a relatively large number of very close friends, usually of all different personality types."
ESFJ,"They are likely to have well-furnished, orderly and attractive homes. They are usually excellents hosts and hostesses, and enjoy throwing parties and having a good time. They like to feel as if they belong to traditions and institutions, and are likely to have a relatively large group of people which they include in their social circles."
ESFJ,"The XXXX is called the 'caregiver', and for good reason. Caring is the very nature of their personality; a personality driven by feeling judgements and supported by a strong sense of the world around them. The XXXX not only sees how situations affect themselves and others, they are concerned about it. Everything that makes them feel valued and successful is bound inextricably to the value and concern they need to exchange with others. 'Give and ye shall receive' is the motto of the XXXX, whose gifts serve the most important function in all communal human processes, from the family to the wider world of care giving such as hospitality, primary teaching, nursing, aged care, social services, human resources and so on. Whilst their judgements might be bound by a somewhat conventional moral code, the XXXX always stands up for what they are certain is the best for others. In some situations this trait can lead them into disaster, particularly if they are thrust into an unsuitable role. The XXXX thrives best where they can make the decisions and organise things to suit their own way of seeing the world. Regardless however of their particular station in life, the XXXX is at their best when it involves caring for and about others, measuring their success by the happiness and gratitude which is reflected back to them from the people in whose lives they play a part."
ESFJ,"strong sense of what is right and wrong Easily empathises with another person Able to share feelings with other people Cares greatly about the welfare of others Open, honest and forthright about the way they see things Sensitive to the needs of others, particularly those judged to be less fortunate Strongly upholds traditional and safe ways of living"
ESFJ,"Very sensitive to how any situation might be inwardly affecting another person Able to see the potential in any human environment for enabling the comfort and safety of others A flair for dramatic illustration and story telling which makes them excellent teachers of the young Able to make strong, people oriented administrative decisions A skill with fashion and decoration which makes people feel good about themselves Able to see outside the 'square' and adjust their values to the facts of a situation"
ESFJ,"They are kind, steady and responsible beings with many special gifts. I would like the XXXX to keep in mind their many positive traits as they read on, and remember that the weaknesses associated with being an XXXX are natural to your type. Although it can be depressing to read about your type's weaknesses, please remember that we offer this information to enact positive change. We want people to grow into their own potential, and to live happy and successful lives."
ESFJ,"Many of the XXXX's weaker characteristics arise because their dominant and Xx function can overshadow the rest of their personality. This generally results in two notable effects. With their Xx function unable to provide sufficient balance to their sharply defined feeling judgements, they often miss the relativities and contingencies of the real world. This very often leads them into conflict with those who believe a situation needs to be properly analysed before its realities can be seen and acted upon. Secondly, with their sense of the world controlled by feelings alone, the narrowly defined XXXX will nearly always find themselves at odds with any view of the world that does not see their own clearly held judgements to be primary, or which does not accord them the 'feeling toned' responses they expect. This can produce a range of effects, every one of which ends in conflict for the XXXX, either with others or with their own feelings."
ESFJ,"May be unable to correctly judge what really is for the best May become spiteful and extremely intractable in the face of clear, logical reasoning May be unable to shrug off feelings that others are not 'good people' May be unable to acknowledge anything that goes against their certainty about the 'correct' or 'right' way to do things May attribute their own problems to arbitrary and unprovable notions about the way people 'ought' to behave May be at a loss when confronted with situations that require basic technical expertise or clear thinking May be oblivious to all but their own viewpoint, valuing their own viewpoint, valuing their own certainties to the exclusion of others May be unable to understand verbal logic, and quickly cut off other's explanations May be falsely certain of the true needs and feeling of others May be extremely vulnerable to superstitions, religious cults, and media manipulation May react too quickly and too emotionally in a situation better dealt with in a more pragmatic fashion"
ESFJ,"Nearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be attributed in various degrees to the They externally mapped, feeling based view of the world not being successfully coupled to an appropriate level of Introverted Sensation. Without this internal balance, the They perceptions and ideas are determined by feeling judgements which are not in always a valid basis for understanding."
ESFJ,"They are usually stable, certain, reliable and caring in their approach to life, but if unbalanced they are likely to treat any point of view other than their own with a kind of amused indifference or a tendency to keep those with differing attitudes and opinions at a distance. Whilst this is natural survival behaviour for the strongly expressed XXXX personality, if they do not learn how to deal with the wide range of differing viewpoints they come into contact with, They can find themselves waging a self created war against all that opposes their own. This conflict often expresses itself in various unambiguous and simplistic 'Us verses Them' generalities, or a penchant for smugly and narrowly defining other people by arbitrary or superstitious belief systems, which often actually symbolise and define their own conflict. At its worst, this conflict with the obstinate and unfeeling contingent realities of the world creates a situation where the XXXX retreats to a kind of psychological castle where, not only none but those who have the 'right' or 'nice' approach can enter, but also where the They feeling based and often tortured logic, attitudes and judgments reign supreme and cannot be questioned; a place where: 'give and you shall receive' can ironically twist quickly into: 'off with his head!'"
ESFJ,"The main driver to the XXXX personality is Xx, whose function is to judge the relative human value of the ideas, behaviours, situations and objects they perceive. The resulting world view is tidy, and ordered according to its worth to the XXXX's own particular character: 'Everything has its place and everything in its place'. If this picture of the world is threatened by external influences, the XXXX generally tries to shut such new information out of their lives. This is totally natural, and works well to protect the individual psyche from getting hurt. However, the XXXX who exercises this type of self-protection regularly will find they can only connect and relate with those who do not actively disturb their increasingly narrow and rigid world view. They will always find justification for their own inappropriate behaviours, and will always find fault with the outside world for problems that they have in their lives. It will be difficult for them to maintain the flexibility needed for a healthy relationship with the messy world outside because the differing ways others value things is a constant affront to their personal judgements."
ESFJ,"It is not an uncommon tendency for the XXXX to support their feeling judgements by selectively using only their immediate perceptions of a situation and how it appears to them. However, if this tendency is given free reign, the resulting XXXX personality is too self-centred to be happy or successful. The XXXX's auxiliary function of Xx must be allowed to grow beyond this limit, where it is used only to support Xx judgements. If the XXXX uses Xx only to serve this purpose, then the XXXX is not using Introversion effectively at all. As a result, the XXXX does not sufficiently recognise and understand the vast number of contingent and differing ways in which the world is perceived by others. They see nothing but their own perspective, and deal with the world only so far as they need to in order to support their perspective. These individuals usually come across as somewhat illogical and full of fixed and often rather staid or conventional ideas about the world. Other people are often surprised by the simplicity, ambiguity and often unrelenting vehemence of their ideas."
ESFJ,"To grow as an individual, the XXXX needs to focus on opening their perspective to include a more accurate picture of the world and its ways. In order to be in a position in which the XXXX is able to perceive and consider data that is foreign to their value system, the XXXX needs to recognise that their world view is not threatened by the new information. The XXXX must consciously tell himself/herself that the judgements of others are not unrelated to reality; that the ideas of others are also just and valid within a wider and less rigorous vision of the world."
ESFJ,"The XXXX who is concerned with personal growth will pay close attention to the way things appear to them. Do they try to find the basic connections between the elements of a situation? Or, do they appreciate only those elements which accord them a feeling of worth? At the moment when some connection or relationship between things is perceived, is the XXXX only concerned with whether that perception supports something they value? Or is she/he concerned with becoming truly appraised of how things fit together in the world? To achieve a better understanding of others and the world in which they live, the XXXX should try to put themselves into the minds of others, to locate and recognise how others see things, before making judgements. They should consciously be aware of their tendency to discard anything that doesn't agree with their carefully adjudicated system of relative worth, and work towards lessening this tendency. They should try to see the way others might see situations, without making personal judgments about how others ought to feel. In general, they should work on exercising their Sensation in a truly introverted sense. In other words, they should use Sensation to recognise that all parts of a situation are necessary for its functionality and that valuing one function or objective connection over another narrows their ability to deal with the real world as it truly is. The XXXX who can successfully envision the world as a realm of functioning and connected parts which are all necessary to its balance can be quite a powerful force for positive change."
ESFJ,"Some They have difficulty fitting into our society. Their problems are often a result of an inability understand the connections and relationships necessary to each situation, a too conventional and dogmatic set of values which limits the way others can relate to them, or an unrealistic and illogical view of the world. These issues mostly stem from using Introverted Sensation in a diminished manner: the lack of a strong internally focused viewpoint allowing an often ambiguous and yet strongly defended set of values to control the personality. An XXXX who attempts to envision a more accurate and impartial view of the world for the sake of understanding the ways of others, rather than quickly deciding how things alone affect them, will have a clearer, more objective understanding of how society is dependant not only upon adherence to values and care for others, but also how the world relies upon structure and laws which function regardless of their human value. He or she will also be more comfortable and less likely to demand that the world and the behaviour of others conform to values of right and wrong, good and bad, worthy and worthless etc. Such well-adjusted They will fit happily into our society."
ISTP,"As an XXXX, your primary mode of living is focused internally, where you deal with things rationally and logically. Your secondary mode is external, where you take things in via your five senses in a literal, concrete fashion."
ISTP,"They have a compelling drive to understand the way things work. They're good at logical analysis, and like to use it on practical concerns. They typically have strong powers of reasoning, although they're not interested in theories or concepts unless they can see a practical application. They like to take things apart and see the way they work."
ISTP,"They have an adventuresome spirit. They are attracted to motorcycles, airplanes, sky diving, surfing, etc. They thrive on action, and are usually fearless. They are fiercely independent, needing to have the space to make their own decisions about their next step. They do not believe in or follow rules and regulations, as this would prohibit their ability to 'do their own thing'. Their sense of adventure and desire for constant action makes They prone to becoming bored rather quickly."
ISTP,"They are loyal to their causes and beliefs, and are firm believers that people should be treated with equity and fairness. Although they do not respect the rules of the 'System', they follow their own rules and guidelines for behavior faithfully. They will not take part in something which violates their personal laws. They are extremely loyal and faithful to their 'brothers'."
ISTP,"They like and need to spend time alone, because this is when they can sort things out in their minds most clearly. They absorb large quantities of impersonal facts from the external world, and sort through those facts, making judgments, when they are alone."
ISTP,"They are action-oriented people. They like to be up and about, doing things. They are not people to sit behind a desk all day and do long-range planning. Adaptable and spontaneous, they respond to what is immediately before them. They usually have strong technical skills, and can be effective technical leaders. They focus on details and practical things. They have an excellent sense of expediency and grasp of the details which enables them to make quick, effective decisions."
ISTP,"They avoid making judgments based on personal values - they feel that judgments and decisions should be made impartially, based on the fact. They are not naturally tuned in to how they are affecting others. They do not pay attention to their own feelings, and even distrust them and try to ignore them, because they have difficulty distinguishing between emotional reactions and value judgments. This may be a problem area for many They."
ISTP,"An XXXX who is over-stressed may exhibit rash emotional outbursts of anger, or on the other extreme may be overwhelmed by emotions and feelings which they feel compelled to share with people (often inappropriately). An XXXX who is down on themself will foray into the world of value judgments - a place which is not natural for the XXXX - and judge themself by their inability to perform some task. They will then approach the task in a grim emotional state, expecting the worst."
ISTP,"They are excellent in a crisis situations. They're usually good athletes, and have very good hand-eye coordination. They are good at following through with a project, and tying up loose ends. They usually don't have much trouble with school, because they are introverts who can think logically. They are usually patient individuals, although they may be prone to occasional emotional outbursts due to their inattention to their own feelings."
ISTP,"They have a lot of natural ability which makes them good at many different kinds of things. However, they are happiest when they are centered in action-oriented tasks which require detailed logical analysis and technical skill. They take pride in their ability to take the next correct step."
ISTP,"They are optimistic, full of good cheer, loyal to their equals, uncomplicated in their desires, generous, trusting and receptive people who want no part in confining commitments. . Interested in how and why things work. Do not function well in regimented, structured environments; they will either feel stifled or become intensely bored. Constantly gather facts about their environment and store them away. Have an excellent ability to apply logic and reason to their immense store of facts to solve problems or discover how things work. Learn best 'hands-on'. Usually able to master theory and abstract thinking, but don't particularly like dealing with it unless they see a practical application. Action-oriented 'doers'. Focused on living in the present, rather than the future. Love variety and new experiences. Highly practical and realistic. Excellent 'trouble-shooters', able to quickly find solutions to a wide variety of practical problems. Results-oriented; they like to see immediate results for their efforts. Usually laid-back and easy-going with people. Risk-takers who thrive on action. Independent and determined - usually dislike committing themselves. Usually quite self-confident"
ISTP,"The XXXX is fortunate because they have the ability to be good at many different kinds of tasks. Their introverted and thinking preferences give them the ability to concentrate and work through problems - that leaves many doors open to them. However, to be happiest, the XXXX needs to lead a lifestyle that offers a great deal of autonomy and does not include much external enforcement of structure. They will do best working for themselves, or working in very flexible environments. Their natural interests lie towards applying their excellent reasoning skills against known facts and data to discover underlying structure, or solutions to practical questions. . Police Officer. Detective. Forensic Pathologist. Computer Programmer. Systems Analyst. Engineer. Construction. Mechanic. Farmer. Pilot. Athlete. Entrepreneur"
ISTP,"They are generally extremely capable individuals who are good at most things which interest them. They are usually bright, interesting, and exciting individuals with a lot to offer. They live almost entirely in the present moment, and usually do not make commitments beyond the immediate foreseeable future. An XXXX probably coined the phrase 'nothing is unconditional'. They strongly prefer to take things one day at a time, rather than make long-term commitments. If a relationship interests them and satisfies their needs, the XXXX will do their part on a daily basis to keep the relationship strong and healthy. If they lose interest in a relationship, their natural tendency will be to move on. . Good listeners. Usually self-confident. Generally optimistic and fun to be with. Practical and realistic, they handle daily concerns. Are not threatened by conflict or criticism. Able to leave a relationship with relative ease once it is over. Able to administer punishment, although they're not interested in doing so. Likely to respect other's needs for space and privacy . Living entirely in the present, they have difficulty with long-term commitments. Not naturally good at expressing feelings and emotions. Not tuned in to what others are feeling, they may be insensitive at times. Tendency to be overly private and hold back part of themselves. Need a lot of personal space, which they don't like to have invaded. They thrive on action and excitement, and may stir things up to create it "
ISTP,"They can be very intense and exciting individuals. Their strong Thinking preference makes them seem rather aloof and 'hard to get'. Their Sensing and Perceiving preferences make them sensual, earthy individuals. These attributes frequently make them attractive to the opposite sex. They live entirely in the current moment, which makes them especially interested in new sensations and experiences. They strongly dislike routine and strict schedules, and resist being controlled by others. They are fiercely independent and need their own space within a relationship. When involved in relationships which provide for their basic needs and which present them with new experiences, the XXXX will be happy to do what's necessary to keep the relationship alive and well. If a relationship becomes boring or oppressive to the XXXX, they will try to fix it, or move on. They take their commitments on a day-by-day basis. Even if they say 'I do', it usually means 'I do for now'. They do not like to make lifelong commitments, although they may very well be involved in lifelong relationships which they have taken one day at a time."
ISTP,"Sexually, the XXXX approaches intimacy as a physical act rather than an expression of love and affection. They are earthy and sensual beings who enthusiastically experience sex with all five senses. They bring spontaneity, creativity, and enthusiasm into the bedroom, and enjoy new experiences. Since aesthetic beauty has such strong appeal to them, they appreciate the 'setting', i.e. bedding, lingerie, cologne, etc."
ISTP,"They love to fix things, and may create problems in their personal relationships, just so that they can have the fun of fixing them."
ISTP,"They have a tendency to hold back their own views on things. They like to listen to other people's views, but are generally non-commital about expressing their own opinions. They have a habit of evading answering questions by asking more questions. This can be frustrating at times to their mates, if they are after a direct answer. The XXXX's decision making process is entirely internal, so they don't feel much need to share their opinions with others. When they are interacting with others, they are in 'information gathering' mode, so they tend to ask questions rather than share views. The XXXX just doesn't feel the need to expose themselves fully to others. When it comes to intimate relationships, the XXXX has the further motivation of protecting themselves. Most They are afraid of having to deal with their deeper feelings. Since their Thinking preference dominates their personality, their Feeling side is their least developed (inferior) function. Consequently, They are usually quite vulnerable and perhaps weak when dealing with their feelings. Their habit of keeping part of themselves hidden may also serve the purpose of keeping a protective wall around their hearts."
ISTP,"Although the XXXX does not usually have a well-developed Feeling side, they frequently do have intense feelings for people. They can feel overpowering love for their mates, although they are likely not to express their emotions, or to express them inadequately or inappropriately if they do venture towards expression. However, unlike many of the other personality types, They feel strong affections one day at a time. One day, they may feel completely, intensely in love with their mate, and the next day they may be totally disinterested, or perhaps even ready to move on. This 'live for the moment' type of approach is different from how most other types experience their feelings, and is difficult for many to understand. Consequently, the XXXX may be called 'fickle' or 'cold'. In fact, they are not really fickle, and certainly not cold. They simply experience their lives on a moment by moment basis, and go along with it's natural flow. However, since most people need more commitment than can be offered when taking things day-by-day, the XXXX who wants to remain in a relationship will have to resolve themself towards being involved in a more traditional commitment. For most They, making a commitment to an intimate relationship will require an effort to stretch themselves outside of their comfort zones. However, those who do so will realize that they can enjoy the benefits of a strong, committed relationship and still live their lives in the present tense."
ISTP,"They are flexible, laid-back, uncontrolling parents who like to take things as they come. Their dislike of being controlled or controlling others extends to their children as well, and they're consequently likely to give their kids a lot of breathing room and space for individual growth. However, when discipline is required, the XXXX will be able to administer it without too much difficulty. They may have difficulty mustering up the enthusiasm to discipline their kids, but once they get going they'll be effective."
ISTP,"XXXX parents are likely to maintain a distance between themselves and their children. They do not feel a tremendous need to pass on their values to their children, or to influence their decisions in life. They're likely to rely on their mates for creating a structured environment for their children to live within. They do not like to be directed or controlled, and are not likely to direct and control others - including their children. They're likely to be relatively uninvolved with the daily happenings of family life, without making a conscious effort to keep interested."
ISTP,"They will enjoy spending one-on-one time with their children pursuing outdoorsy activities, such as fishing, boating, hunting, etc. It is during these private moments that the XXXX will take the opportunity to get to know their children's perspectives, and to pass on the XXXX's interests and perspectives."
ISTP,"They have an enthusiastic, childlike approach to life that is attractive to others. As Xxs, they also have some real substance to them which prevents them from being entirely frivolous and hedonic in their pursuits. They are laid-back and flexible, and generally accepting of a wide range of behavior. These attributes make them valued friends and confidantes."
ISTP,"They usually have a selection of friends who share their love of particular hobbies and pasttimes. They might have a friend who they ski with, and another who they shoot pool with, etc. They generally have no interest or patience with individuals who do not share their interests, and will spend little or no time with them. They have a difficult time understanding people with extremely strong iNtuitive preferences, and are not likely to spend time with these individuals unless they share a common interest or hobby. They enjoy spending time with Extraverts, whose enthusiastic, talkative natures are attractive to the more reserved XXXX, but they will eventually tire of their 'bubbliness'. The XXXX is able to get along well with people of any personality type, but is likely to value and bond only those with whom they have common interests."
ISTP,"People with the XXXX personality type are action-oriented thinkers. They are highly tuned into their immediate environment, and driven to interact with it in a hands-on fashion. It is by working with things in their environment that they experience and understand life. By working physically with their environment, they have a natural and immediate understanding of how things work, and how best to achieve their identified goals. Although they constantly use logic to determine how to best manipulate objects in their immediate situation, they are not naturally analytical in a more objective sense. When they step back to methodically analyze the relationship between objects in their world, they often lose touch with their understanding. Their understanding is intimately tied into their physical experience with reality. It is immediate and wholistic. They are naturally 'in-sync' with the physical world, and value life largely in terms of their ability to flow with and conquer the physical challenges presented to them. Although they think about and value past experiences, they live almost entirely in the here and now. They are natural mechanics, athletes, musicians, technicians, and engineers. They excel at tasks that require a great deal of tactile mastery, as well as quick, logic-based action. They are most comfortable using their known skills, rather than being thrown into situations with which they have no personal experience. The nuances of variation in each individual situation will bring a sense of newness and freshness to the experience for the XXXX. They often resist and rebel situations that are entirely new, or that require a great deal of structured planning and thinking. This way of thinking is foreign to the XXXX, and therefore uncomfortable. When someone tries to push or control the XXXX into these situations, he or she is likely to 'walk away' from that person without looking back. Their resistance to structure may cause them to quit school early, quit jobs that they find stifling, or quit relationships that have too many expectations. They are often likeable and have more friends and social interaction than is normal for an Introvert. The XXXX genuinely enjoys the company of their friends, and needs their input in his or her physical world to maintain their understanding of their own place in the world. An XXXX's feeling of success is dependent primarily upon their mastery of their physical world, but is also dependent upon the existence of strong, reliable, interpersonal relationships. Without these relationships, the XXXX is likely to avoid relationships, isolate him or herself, and feel very vulnerable to rejection and hurt."
ISTP,"They have a natural ability to focus and 'become one' with their immediate environment. This ability allows them to be great athletes, dancers, and musicians. They have an innately graceful connection with the physical world. They are highly in tune with their physical surroundings, and therefore have well-developed aesthetic appreciation. They appreciate beauty. If they are so inclined, they may develop their ability to control the physical world into some form of art expression, and become artists. They are exceptional troubleshooters in emergency situations. They can quickly take in the current situation and apply logic immediately to take steps that control the problem. Since the XXXX's use of logic is based on their personal experience, their ability to troubleshoot will get better and better as they gain more experience. For this reason, They who are mechanics, technicians, and computer analysts (for example) often achieve 'guru' status after they have been working in the field for a long time. They're very sensual and earthy people. They usually have a good deal of sex appeal and attractive sensuality."
ISTP,"They have attractive and compelling personalities, and are well-liked and accepted by most people. They're usually quite intelligent, and can work through difficult problems. They understand the benefits of close relationships, and understand how to support and enhance these relationships. They can handle just about any task that they are presented with."
ISTP,"The XXXX gets 'stuck in a rut' and only does those things that are known and comfortable to the XXXX. The XXXX resists and rejects anything that doesn't support their own experiential understanding of the world. If there is a conflict between their own way of life and something that they encounter, they don't perceive that 'something' in an objective sense. Rather, they reject it to avoid conflict and to preserve the sanctity of their inner world. They choose to surround themselves with people who support their own way of life, and reject people who think or live differently. They may become overly paranoid about social organizations and institutions trying to control them. They may unknowingly or uncaringly hurt people's feelings. They may be completely unaware of how to express their inner world to others in a meaningful way. They may be completely unaware of the type of communication that is often desireable and (to some degree) expected in an intimate relationship. If they are aware of the kinds of things that are appropriate to say and do to foster emotional bonding, they may be unable to appreciate the value of such actions. They may feel too vulnerable to express themselves in this fashion, and so reject the entire idea. If pushed beyond their comfort level to form commitments or emotional bonds, they may reject a relationship entirely. Under stress, they may show intense emotions that seem disproportionate to the situation."
ISTP,"Nearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be attributed in various degrees to the common XXXX problem of only taking in information that relates to or supports their own life experience. The XXXX is driven to work with and understand his or her world by applying their special brand of logic (an immediate, spatial, 'fuzzy' logic) to their physical experience. They don't necessarily have a goal in mind to achieve from this process - it is the process itself that is rewarding to the XXXX. In their zeal for the satisfaction that comes from mastering their physical environment in such a way, They often selectively choose to put themselves in situations in which they have the opportunity to exercise these skills. That's certainly not a problem. Most personality types choose to do the things that they're best at most often. Such is the nature of capitalizing upon our strengths. The problem rears its ugly head when the goal of the XXXX becomes to achieve their personal satisfaction at all costs."
ISTP,"It is healthy to choose your paths and goals in life so that they coincide with what you find rewarding, and what you're really good at. However, it sometimes happens that we take this approach a bit too far and sacrifice an accurate and objective understanding of the world for a more narrow vision that is easier and comfortable for us to deal with. The XXXX affects this problem when they stop taking in information in a truly objective sense, and instead only take in information that supports their way of life."
ISTP,"The dominant function of the XXXX is Xx. This function is supported closely and importantly by the auxiliary function of Xx. Xx perceives the world and sends information into the psyche, where it is processed by Xx. An XXXX who uses their Xx function in a diminished way is one who chooses to restrict their environment to people and places that support their favored activities. In such a way, the XXXX prevents his or her psyche from having to consider data from differing viewpoints and lifestyles, and thus promotes a lifestyle that allows them to frequently exercise and enhance their known tactile skills. It serves their immediate needs, which are the primary focus of the XXXX. However, it also promotes a lifestyle that is essentially self-centered and narrow in focus. It solves short-term problems, and creates long-term ones."
ISTP,"The XXXX's inferior (fourth) function is Xx. This means that the XXXX is not naturally in tune with how other people are feeling, or with social expectations. In fact, the XXXX is likely to reject the importance of social rituals, rules, and expectations. This is a natural weak point for the XXXX, which no doubt causes strife to the XXXX and their love partner. This weakness can be overcome by developing their Xx to the point that they can perceive Feeling type expectations in the external world. They don't have to use Xx to understand how to act in situations. They can perceive the expected behavior from their Xx function. However, if they are restricting their incoming data to only those things that support their existing way of life, then they are not learning from Xx at all. They are not growing their understanding of social and intimate behaviors - rather, they are reducing the importance of this type of understanding to their own life. In these situations, They shy away from very close personal relationships, and feel more vulnerable and less sure of themselves in situations that involve expressing their emotions."
ISTP,"To grow as an individual, the XXXX needs to focus on taking in as much information as possible through Xx. He or she needs to allow themself to get into situations that they aren't necessarily comfortable with, or that are different from the situations that they would normally choose in life. The XXXX learns from experience, so the best way for the XXXX to grow as a person is to open him or herself to new experiences. Be aware of the tendency to want to run out and do something 'new' that is actually just a different opportunity to exercise a known skill. Your task, as a person interested in personal growth, is to understand the world in a truly objective fashion, rather than understanding how the world fits in with your way of life."
ISTP,"They usually have a loyal group of friends that they fit in with and feel comfortable with. The problems that They have with regards to fitting into our world are not usually related to platonic friendships. Usually, the XXXX has trouble finding and maintaining a love relationship. The XXXX usually has very simple needs and expectations from their mates, and they're surprised and confused to find that their mates have more complex demands. They feel inadequate to meeting their mate's needs, and begin to get very uncomfortable with the situation as they perceive that they are expected to do something that it unknown to them. They back away from the relationship. Outside of a relationship, they feel more unloved and unappreciated, but are afraid to commit to a relationship because they fear rejection and hurt."
ESTP,"As an XXXX, your primary mode of living is focused externally, where you take things in via your five senses in a literal, concrete fashion. Your secondary mode is internal, where you deal with things rationally and logically."
ESTP,"They are outgoing, straight-shooting types. Enthusiastic and excitable, They are 'doers' who live in the world of action. Blunt, straight-forward risk-takers, they are willing to plunge right into things and get their hands dirty. They live in the here-and-now, and place little importance on introspection or theory. The look at the facts of a situation, quickly decide what should be done, execute the action, and move on to the next thing."
ESTP,"They have an uncanny ability to perceive people's attitudes and motivations. They pick up on little cues which go completely unnoticed by most other types, such as facial expressions and stance. They're typically a couple of steps ahead of the person they're interacting with. They use this ability to get what they want out of a situation. Rules and laws are seen as guidelines for behavior, rather than mandates. If the XXXX has decided that something needs to be done, then their 'do it and get on with it' attitude takes precendence over the rules. However, the XXXX tends to have their own strong belief in what's right and what's wrong, and will doggedly stick to their principles. The Rules of the Establishment may hold little value to the XXXX, but their own integrity mandates that they will not under any circumstances do something which they feel to be wrong."
ESTP,"They have a strong flair for drama and style. They're fast-moving, fast-talking people who have an appreciation for the finer things in life. They may be gamblers or spendthrifts. They're usually very good at story telling and improvising. They typically makes things up as they go along, rather than following a plan. They love to have fun, and are fun people to be around. They can sometimes be hurtful to others without being aware of it, as they generally do not know and may not care about the effect their words have on others. It's not that they don't care about people, it's that their decision-making process does not involve taking people's feelings into account. They make decisions based on facts and logic."
ESTP,"XXXX's least developed area is their intuitive side. They are impatient with theory, and see little use for it in their quest to 'get things done'. An XXXX will occasionally have strong intuitions which are often way off-base, but sometimes very lucid and positive. The XXXX does not trust their instincts, and is suspicious of other people's intuition as well."
ESTP,"The XXXX often has trouble in school, especially higher education which moves into realms where theory is more important. The XXXX gets bored with classes in which they feel they gain no useful material which can be used to get things done. The XXXX may be brilliantly intelligent, but school will be a difficult chore for them."
ESTP,"The XXXX needs to keep moving, and so does well in careers where he or she is not restricted or confined. They make extremely good salespersons. They will become stifled and unhappy dealing with routine chores. They have a natural abundance of energy and enthusiasm, which makes them natural entrepreneurs. They get very excited about things, and have the ability to motivate others to excitement and action. The can sell anyone on any idea. They are action-oriented, and make decisions quickly. All-in-all, they have extraordinary talents for getting things started. They are not usually so good at following through, and might leave those tasks to others. Mastering the art of following through is something which They should pay special attention to."
ESTP,"They are practical, observant, fun-loving, spontaneous risk-takers with an excellent ability to quickly improvise an innovative solution to a problem. They're enthusiastic and fun to be with, and are great motivators. If an XXXX recognizes their real talents and operates within those realms, they can accomplish truly exciting things. . Action-oriented. Live in the present moment. Dislike abstract theory without practical application. Like to see immediate results for their efforts. Fast-paced and energetic. Flexible and adaptable. Resourceful. Seldom work from a plan - make things up as they go. Fun to be around. Highly observant. Excellent memory for details. Excellent people skills. Good-natured. Excellent ability to see an immediate problem and quickly devise a solution. Attracted to adventure and risk. May be flashy or showy. Like initiating things - not necessarily following them through to completion "
ESTP,"They have some advantageous traits that are unique to their personality type. Their skills of observation make them extremely good at correctly analyzing and assessing other peoples' motives or perspectives. Their people skills allow them to use this knowledge to their advantage while interacting with people. For this reason, They are excellent salespeople. They also have a special ability to react quickly and effectively to an immediate need, such as in an emergency or crisis situation. This is a valuable skill in many different professions, perhaps most notably in action-oriented professions, such as police work. They enjoy new experiences and dealing with people, and dislike being confined in structured or regimented environments. They also want to see an immediate result for their actions, and don't like dealing with a lot of high-level theory where that won't be the case. For these reasons, they should choose careers that involve a lot of interaction with people, and do not require performing a lot of routine, detailed tasks. . Facilitator. Sales Representatives. Marketing Personnel. Police / Detective Work. Paramedic / Emergency Medical Technician. PC Technicians or Network Cablers. Computer Technical Support. Entrepreneurs. Athlete"
ESTP,"They are gregarious and fun-loving individuals who want to make the most of every moment. They love action, and always seem to be doing something. This enthusiasm is carried over to their personal relationships, which they approach with the desire to make the most of their relationships on a daily basis. They tend to get bored easily, and may be prone to switching relationships frequently unless they find an outlet for their boredom elsewhere. They approach life on a day-by-day basis, so long-term commitments are not naturally comfortable for the XXXX. They may feel tremendously committed, but they want to take their commitments day by day."
ESTP,"Can be quite charming. Witty, clever, and popular. Earthy and sensual. Not personally threatened by conflict or criticism. Excellent and clear-headed dealing with emergency situations. Enthusiastic and fun-loving, they try to make everything enjoyable. As 'big kids' themselves, they're eager, willing and able to spend time with their kids. Likely to enjoy lavishing their loved ones with big gifts (both a strength and a weakness) . Not naturally in tune with what others are feeling. Not naturally good at expressing feelings and emotions. May inadvertantly hurt others with insensitive language. May be very good with money, but highly risky with it as well. Living in the present, they're not usually good long-range planners. May fall into the habit of ignoring conflict, rather than solving it. Don't naturally make lifelong commitments - they take things one day at a time. Prone to get bored easily. More likely than other type to leave relationships quickly when they get bored. Likely to enjoy lavishing their loved ones with big gifts (both a strength and a weakness)"
ESTP,"They are enthusiastic and friendly people who approach everything in a Big way. They can be extremely charming, especially in the beginning of a relationship. They're also quite generous, and known for 'sweeping their partners off their feet'. They're very sensual and earthy, and are usually live fast-paced lives where their focus is on the present moment. They bring a lot of fun and energy into their personal relationships."
ESTP,"Commitment is not a strong point for the XXXX. Living almost entirely in the present moment, they're not comfortable with making plans far in advance for their future. If this tendency is not addressed in the XXXX, they may fall into a pattern of jumping from relationship to relationship without ever making a real commitment. If this is okay with the XXXX, then that behavior is fine. Most people at some point in their lives do wish to settle down. If the XXXX reaches that point, there's no reason they can't make a commitment as long as they consciously renew it to themselves daily."
ESTP,"Sexually, the XXXX approaches intimacy as a tangible, fun way to make the most of the relationship in the present moment. They're keenly aware of their senses, and so are very sensual and earthy lovers. They are likely to view intimacy from a lighter, physical perspective rather than as an opportunity for expressing a lot of verbal affection and affirmation. If partnered with someone who has the Feeling preference, they should consciously make the effort to sometimes verbally express affection during intimacy."
ESTP,"XXXX's are not naturally in tune with what others are feeling, and may lack in the areas of giving affirmation, gratitude, and support to their partners. They tend to believe that actions speak louder than words, and so don't understand the need to say things which should be obvious. Types with the Feeling preference require positive feedback in a way that They don't. The best gift that the XXXX partner can give to their Feeling mate is often the expression of their love."
ESTP,"There is a little bit of kid in every grown-up XXXX, so they're likely to really enjoy spending time 'playing' with their children. The XXXX's goal with regards to parenthood is usually not structured or organized. They tend to take things as they come, and teach their kids what seems appropriate when situations occur. The XXXX is enthusiastic about both teaching their children and learning from them. They're likely to value their kids as individuals, and allow them to have their own voices in the family unit."
ESTP,"The XXXX doesn't believe that they have all the answers. They believe that many things in life have no obvious answer. They tend to be very down to earth individuals who do not believe that they're better than others, or that they have some great voice of authority within them. Therefore, they're likely to be their children's friend and companion more than a disciplinary guide. However, the XXXX will not have a problem with issuing punishment and discipline when necessary. But, the XXXX has such easy-going ways that they're not likely to see the need for discipline as frequently as some other types do. This may be a point of contention between the XXXX and their mate."
ESTP,"Highly practical and quick-acting, the XXXX is excellent to have around in an emergency. They're tuned in to everyday needs, and are likely to be good providers of practical care. They will not be overly expressive of their feelings for their children, and may be gruff and unnatural when expressing love."
ESTP,"In general, They are enthusiastic parents who usually form strong bonds of friendship with their offspring."
ESTP,"They are very good with people. They have excellent skills of observation, and know how to act appropriately with all types of people. Consequently, the XXXX can get along with just about any personality type."
ESTP,"The XXXX is not likely to choose to be around all of the personality types. They have little patience for iNtuitive Thinking types, who seem very abstract and theoretical to the XXXX, who values action. The XXXX is likely to choose to be around people who have similar interests to their own - such as sports-oriented interests. They will probably spend time with their friends doing things, rather than just sitting around hanging out."
ESTP,"The XXXX is usually quite popular, because they're enthusiastic, fast-paced, friendly, talkative, and know how to have a good time. Some They tend to 'move on' quickly in life, and don't form very long friendships. Many They have lifelong friends, because although they take life day by day, they feel tremendous loyal and 'brotherhood' towards their peers. They're highly valued by their friends for their fun-loving natures and loyalty."
ESTP,"With a dominant function of Xx, and an auxiliary function of Xx, people with the XXXX personality type have a heightened need for sensory experience and for tactile engagement with their physical environment. The XXXX is most comfortable when they can treat life as a big game in which they must be quick to use their skills in order to win. In such a game-playing scenario, the XXXX is most likely to be the winner, as no other personality type is as quick on their feet as the XXXX."
ESTP,"They have an amazingly ability to size up people in an instant and come up with an accurate ballpark understanding of where they are coming from. The XXXX cannot help using this skill, it is natural for them, but it brings them great satisfaction to be able to use this skill to enact some personal gain, or to 'win the game.' The XXXX is also strongly driven to tangibly interact with their immediate physical environment. This need manifests itself in many ways, most commonly as an attraction to sports or physical challenges, and as a desire to always be doing something. They are the great Doers. If you want to make something happen quickly, ask an XXXX. These inherent skills make the XXXX likely to find success professionally as salespeople or professional athletes. However, any career that capitalizes on their people skills or their ability to maneuver within their physical world AND gives them immediate feedback is likely to be a good fit for the XXXX."
ESTP,"The XXXX's need to be engaged with their immediate, external world makes success on a personal level more challenging. They feel happiest when they are outside of themselves, but personal success requires going within to get to know the self. However, once these needs are recognized, they are not mutually exclusive. The XXXX who feeds their constant drive for new sensory experiences as well as their need for real reflection upon those experiences and impressions will find a deeper level of personal satisfaction than the XXXX who allows his immediate needs for sensory experiences to yank him about."
ESTP,"However, even those They who have developed their ability to reflect on matters will always be connected at some base level to the strong desire for new experiences, and will get their 'bread and butter' feelings of success from conquering challenges in their physical environment. They need to know they've got the goods, won the moment, done the job. Once given a task that intrigues them, or having discovered something new to be tried, very little will stop them from doing all they can to meet the challenge, and thereby achieve what they consider to be a personal success. Success to an XXXX is usually not measured in ongoing terms, but in transient moments of achievement, moments which bring the XXXX the needed feeling of having won the day."
ESTP,"great talent for reading people and knowing 'where they're at' by just watching their behavior and mannerisms. The ability to draw upon an extremely detailed and ready knowledge of the physical world around them at a moment's notice. A competitive flair which drives them to win out in difficult situations. They love to have the odds stacked against them, which makes them great troubleshooters or the type of salespeople who can cold canvass a winning deal from the hardest client. A mental toughness which makes them extremely hard to beat. In any contest, the XXXX will almost always be the last man standing. A strong, 'get after it' mentality that causes them to get things done."
ESTP,"The ability to recognize when others are uncomfortable or in trouble and deal with their problems. The ability to realize that there is value in meeting other people's needs in a real way. An understanding that other people may have a different perspective on life, and that other perspectives may be useful and valid. An ability to make the most of their winning capabilities over a long term. A special talent for showing others how to make the most of situations. Such They can be extraordinary teachers of positive life skills. A knack for showing not only how certain things can be done, but how they can be done in a far more valuable or efficient way. Such They are an asset to any company involved in manufacturing. A skill for understanding the behavior of people and predicting patterns. They can make very good detectives or analysts."
ESTP,"It is important to realize that type weaknesses are just the blind spots behind our stronger character traits, and that the more undesirable characteristics specific to a type are usually limited to those people whose type is heavily expressed, and then only if circumstances have combined to narrow or circumvent that person's natural development. So in reading what follows, it is worth remembering that, in describing these typical tendencies and the negative patterns of behavior which can flow from them, we are building an understanding for positive development. Every person is differently made, and we must always remember that these so called 'weaknesses' are the unavoidable, understandable and natural characteristics of our type."
ESTP,"Can become morose or even antagonistic in situations offering little promise of advantage or the possibility to 'do something.' May be manipulative, taking advantage of other people's weaknesses for their own gain. May be unwilling or unable to plan anything in advance themselves, or to follow other's careful plans. Can be overconfident of their own cunning or ability, ignoring problems which eventually catch up with them on their blind side. May find it difficult or be actually unwilling to follow through where an ongoing commitment is expected. In relationship situations may be overbearing, demanding and/or uncaring of the feelings of their partner. When alone or in reduced circumstances may be subject to dark or morbid feelings about themselves. May be unable to maintain employment for any length of time, losing credibility with potential employers or clients by job hopping. May become so engrossed in challenging activities that they lose all sense of proportion, neglecting themselves and their relationships. Without challenges of their own, may become focused on the behavior of others, particularly that of family or employees, insisting that they live up to what the XXXX sees as the proper code or level of accomplishment."
ESTP,"Because the XXXX is driven to experience the world through concrete sensation, their need for sensual experience combines with the possibilities of the moment to provide everything they feel is necessary to life. Using Xx only to justify or enhance their sensual needs, the XXXX can easily flow with the world in a reckless manner, their own behavior mapped and justified by a ruling grid locked only to the objective action of the moment. Many of the difficulties described above flow from this common XXXX trait of attending only to the world and the people around them for the sake of satisfying their constant need for fresh experiences and new conquests. For the XXXX who lacks the support of a well adapted rational, judging function, the objective world remains an endlessly fascinating playground, where the constantly changing rules of the game often provide the only real codes of conduct they live by."
ESTP,"Without a well developed Xx function enabling the XXXX to reflect upon the consequences of their actions and desires, the feelings and needs of others can seem of little concern to them. Often, those who cannot match the XXXX round for round are considered persons of little consequence, or valued only as useful pawns in an endless game of one-upmanship where the gratification of the They needs is the only object. In addition to this, because Feeling is the XXXX's tertiary function, its judgments tend to be colored by the unconscious background, which means that it is often used negatively. In responding to the XXXX's sense driven thinking assessments, such a feeling function plays down empathy and enhances the maintenance of negative feelings about others, particularly when they do not 'go along' with the XXXX's primary function driven ways and needs."
ESTP,"Under such conditions the strongly expressing XXXX, whose auxiliary Xx function serves only to make biased, supportive, 'correct' judgments about their own behavior, will often 'stand outside the circle', their biased judgments reducing others to a mere audience, expected to support the They notions without question. In relationships this can be a danger, for it means the XXXX will rarely accede to the feeling based demands of others, nor give credit to those ideas which arise from an intuitive outlook on life. Their behavior in this regard often borders on outright contempt or a sullen refusal to accept anything outside their own purview."
ESTP,"Such strongly expressing They can sometimes find themselves without any truly close relationships, for their behavior often provides a strong signal to others, who sense that 'here be dragons', and consequently offer as little as possible of their personal feelings or worldly knowledge as grist to the They one-upmanship mill. Under these circumstances, whilst the XXXX may have lots of acquaintances and partners in fun, there will be very few who will befriend them at any truly supportive, emotional level."
ESTP,"Apart from the reasons given above, some narrowly expressing They can sometimes find themselves isolated because of the unusual things they believe about people and the world - particularly in regard to the reasons they believe certain things happen. The XXXX is extremely familiar with the workings of the immediate, rational world of the senses, but because their Intuition is a virtually unconscious function, their ideas about things outside their ken can quite often be extraordinarily quaint, superstitious or just downright bizarre, and their thinking can weave some amazing logic to support these beliefs. This rarely affects their day to day life, for these ideas and superstitions quite often support their keenness and abilities, but in a situation where truly intuitive or theoretical notions are considered relevant and important, the XXXX can find themself very much the odd man out."
ESTP,"Of all the personality types, the strongly expressing XXXX can be the hardest to convince that their world view is not the only valid one; that it does not necessarily spring from the best and only way to be; that everyone else in the world who is 'normal' does not approach life in the same way as the XXXX."
ESTP,"To grow as an individual, the XXXX needs to focus on freeing their thinking from the control of Xx and allow themself the space to make careful, rational judgments. Not only about the immediate, external situation, but also about the ways in which it can be managed to create a more valuable, long term result. The XXXX's capacity to do this is innate; it hides just beneath the surface and takes only a few deliberate moments to allow it to work. All the XXXX needs to do is to recognize the difference between thinking with the moment, with the subject of their immediate sense impressions, and the thinking they do when nothing else grasps their attention. The XXXX needs to recognize that the second kind of thinking, this 'alone with self' space, is full of potential for careful judgment of their actions and consideration of the best course for the future. Xx is in truth the XXXX secret weapon. It is Xx working in the background of their life which makes the XXXX such a potent personality. Bringing it into the foreground, allowing its power to be no longer a secret to them is the key to XXXX development."
ESTP,"want to offer the XXXX some specific suggestions and advice here, for bringing the value of introspection into focus it isn't just a matter of flipping a switch in the head. One of the reasons for this is that, when uncoupled from the fascinations of the outer world and reality, the XXXX's Xx tends to get caught up in the negative judgments and images which flow from their feeling and intuitive functions; all too easily falling into a cloudy, uncertain world of anxieties and sinister implications. The XXXX's inner space needs to be cleared of this often childish and ill-informed miasma of negativity. So it is necessary to reassure yourself, to calmly and decisively insist upon quiet in your inner mind, and have faith that all concerns will be taken care of by the 'adult of the household' (the mature version of Xx.)"
ESTP,"Turning off the world and getting into your own space can be difficult at the beginning, but it provides the greatest rewards. For the XXXX doesn't need to learn how to think, they already do it extremely well - they just need to turn their thinking upon themselves. They need to measure and evaluate their usefulness, their actions, their relationships in ways that look for quality, and in ways to offer value to all things and people in their lives."
ESTP,"Challenge yourself. Challenges are simple stuff for the XXXX, and all it really takes is a few moments of reflection each day. Ask yourself regularly: 'What am I doing? Why am I doing it? Who benefits from it?' Ask these questions in every type of situation, and discover how the answers begin showing a path toward not only greater understanding of self and others, but also show ways to include others in a relationship with your whole self. Soon you will discover your feelings and intuitions coming on board with a more positive and inclusive force. Growing yourself soon becomes easy, because it just takes the simple routine of letting your innate power of considered thought work upon your own life, rather than only using it to support what's going on outside. Think about it."
ESTP,"They usually have a strong group of supporters, both at work and socially. They are often popular, their appeal is magnetic and they attract those who would like to do the things they can do. The problems the XXXX has fitting into the world tend to be related to the flip side of this attractive and challenging exterior, for the deeper and more intimate side of people tends to avoid them, just as the XXXX tends to avoid the deeper connections. They have no trouble attracting lovers and admirers, they simply have trouble keeping them, for once relationships begin to demand constancy and deep, feeling based connections, the XXXX is often left wondering what the fuss was about. Their inadequacy in this regard can often make others feel they are lacking any real feelings or desire for commitment, whilst the truth is that they simply do not know the path to such things without a long and difficult learning period. They are more frightened of feelings rather than unable to feel, they are more timid of commitment rather than unable to commit. In relationships the XXXX needs reassurance, but all too often their needs are unspoken and interpreted as inabilities."
ESFP,"As an XXXX, your primary mode of living is focused externally, where you take things in via your five senses in a literal, concrete fashion. Your secondary mode is internal, where you deal with things according to how you feel about them, or how they fit with your personal value system."
ESFP,"They live in the world of people possibilties. They love people and new experiences. They are lively and fun, and enjoy being the center of attention. They live in the here-and-now, and relish excitement and drama in their lives."
ESFP,"They have very strong inter-personal skills, and may find themselves in the role of the peacemaker frequently. Since they make decisions by using their personal values, they are usually very sympathetic and concerned for other people's well-being. They're usually quite generous and warm. They are very observant about other people, and seem to sense what is wrong with someone before others might, responding warmly with a solution to a practical need. They might not be the best advice-givers in the world, because they dislike theory and future-planning, but they are great for giving practical care."
ESFP,"XXXX is definitely a spontaneous, optimistic individual. They love to have fun. If the XXXX has not developed their Thinking side by giving consideration to rational thought processing, they tend to become over-indulgent, and place more importance on immediate sensation and gratification than on their duties and obligations. They may also avoid looking at long-term consequences of their actions."
ESFP,"For the XXXX, the entire world is a stage. They love to be the center of attention and perform for people. They're constantly putting on a show for others to entertain them and make them happy. They enjoy stimulating other people's senses, and are extremely good at it. They would love nothing more than for life to be a continual party, in which they play the role of the fun-loving host."
ESFP,"They love people, and everybody loves an XXXX. One of their greatest gifts is their general acceptance of everyone. They are upbeat and enthusiastic, and genuinely like almost everybody. An XXXX is unfailingly warm and generous with their friends, and they generally treat everyone as a friend. However, once crosesed, an XXXX is likely to make a very strong and stubborn judgment against the person who crossed them. They are capable of deep dislike in such a situation."
ESFP,"The XXXX under a great deal of stress gets overwhelmed with negatives thoughts and possibilities. As an optimistic individual who lives in the world of possibilities, negative possibilities do not sit well with them. In an effort to combat these thoughts, they're likely to come up with simple, global statements to explain away the problem. These simplistic explanations may or may not truly get to the nature of the issue, but they serve the XXXX well by allowing them to get over it."
ESFP,"They are likely to be very practical, although they hate structure and routine. They like to 'go with the flow', trusting in their ability to improvise in any situation presented to them. They learn best with 'hands-on' experience, rather than by studying a book. They're uncomfortable with theory. If an XXXX hasn't developed their intuitive side, they may tend to avoid situations which involve a lot of theoretical thinking, or which are complex and ambiguous. For this reason, an XXXX may have difficulty in school. On the other hand, the XXXX does extremely well in situations where they're allowed to learn by interacting with others, or in which they 'learn by doing'."
ESFP,"They have a very well-developed appreciation for aesthetic beauty, and an excellent sense of space and function. If they have the means, they're likely to have to have many beautiful possessions, and an artfully furnished home. In general, they take great pleasure in objects of aesthetic beauty. They're likely to have a strong appreciation for the finer things in life, such as good food and good wine."
ESFP,"The XXXX is a great team player. He or she is not likely to create any problems or fuss, and is likely to create the most fun environment possible for getting the task done. They will do best in careers in which they are able to use their excellent people skills, along with their abilities to meld ideas into structured formats. Since they are fast-paced individuals who like new experiences, they should choose careers which offer or require a lot of diversity, as well as people skills."
ESFP,"They usually like to feel strongly bonded with other people, and have a connection with animals and small children that is not found in most other types. They're likely to have a strong appreciation for the beauties of nature as well."
ESFP,"The XXXX has a tremendous love for life, and knows how to have fun. They like to bring others along on their fun-rides, and are typically a lot of fun to be with. They're flexible, adaptable, genuinely interested in people, and usually kind-hearted. They have a special ability to get a lot of fun out of life, but they need to watch out for the pitfalls associated with living entirely in the moment. . Genuinely and warmly interested in people. Value people's feelings. Live in the present moment. Are stimulated and excited by new experiences. Practical and realistic. Warmly interested in people. Know how to have a good time, and how to make things fun for others. Independent and resourceful. Spontaneous - seldom plan ahead. Hate structure and routine. Dislike theory and long written explanations. Feel special bond with children and animals. Strongly developed aesthetic appreciation for things. Great people skills "
ESFP,"They are good at many things, but will not be happy unless they have a lot of contact with people, and a lot of new experiences. They should choose careers that provide them with the opportunity to use their great people skills and practical perspective, that will also provide them with enough new challenges that they will not become bored.. Artist. Performer or Actor. Sales Rep. Counselor. Social Work. Child Care. Fashion Designer. Interior Decorator. Consultant. Photographer. Athlete"
ESFP,"They are fun and delightful to be with. They live for the moment, and know how to make the most of each moment. They are genuinely, warmly interested in people, and love to make others happy. They're usually very kind-hearted and generous, and are always going out of their way to do something nice for someone. Their affection is simple, straight-forward and honest. They dislike theory and complexities. They often resist forming relationships which require them to function on a high Intuitive or Thinking level. They prefer for things to be light and happy, although their warmth and affection runs deep. Their potential downfall is the tendency to live entirely for the present moment, and therefore to sometimes be unaware of the direction that their relationship is heading, or to be easily distracted from long-term commitments. . Enthusiastic and fun-loving, they make everything enjoyable. Clever, witty, direct, and popular, people are drawn towards them. Earthy and sensual. Down to earth and practical, able to take care of daily needs. Artistic and creative, they're likely to have attractive homes. Flexible and diverse, they 'go with the flow' extremely well. They can leave bad relationships, although it's not easy. Try to make the most of every moment. Generous and warm-hearted . May be frivolous and risky with money. Tend to be materialistic. Extreme dislike of criticism, likely to take things extremely personally. Likely to ignore or escape conflict situations rather than face them. Lifelong commitments may be a struggle for them - they take things one day at a time. Don't pay enough attention to their own needs. Tendency to neglect their health, or even abuse their bodies. Always excited by something new, they may change partners frequently "
ESFP,"They embrace their love relationships in a Big way - similar to the way they approach their lives in general. They love to be in love, and will try to make the most of each moment. They take things on a day-by-day basis, and are uncomfortable thinking too much about the future, or making plans far in advance. For this reason, They are not natural long-term commitment people. They may feel tremendously committed on a day-by-day basis, but they do not naturally plan for their futures."
ESFP,"This commitment issue is a potential pitfall for the XXXX. Many people of this type overcome this potential weakness, and become involved in truly satisfying, lifelong relationships. Others do not address this weakness, and move from relationship to relationship without forming real commitments, convincing themselves that this is what they truly want."
ESFP,"Sexually, the XXXX is a very earthy and sensual individual who seeks and enjoys intimate contact with their partners. Living in the here-and-now, they throughly embrace and enjoy the experience with all five senses. They are generous and warm, and highly interested in making their partners happy."
ESFP,"They tend to be materialistic, and somewhat caught up in 'what others think' of them. They should take care that this doesn't interfere with their personal relationships, since many of the others types will not be able to relate to their perspectives on these matters."
ESFP,"They do not handle conflict well at all. They take any sort of criticism very personally, and consider it to be a general indictment of their character. They may react with anger and harsh words which they would later like to take back. They would do themselves a favor if they would come to realize that criticism can be looked at constructively, rather than destructively. If they can hear criticism without feeling personally threatened, the XXXX will have come a very long way towards greatly improving the strength and health of their relationships."
ESFP,"They are extremely literal and concrete when communicating. They say things in a very direct, abrupt manner, and can sometimes even unintentionally seem quite harsh. They like things to be communicated to them in a similar, concrete fashion. They dislike theory and abstraction, and will frequently misunderstand the jist of a communication if it is not communicated in a factual, present-tense manner. Discussions regarding the future or the past are not the XXXX's strong suit, and in fact they're likely to miscontrue future-looking statements as something that needs immediate attention. When they discover that the discussion is not regarding an immediate concern, they become disinterested."
ESFP,"They are in general very warm and giving people, with simple needs and demands from their partners. They just want to be happy, and want to bring happiness to others. They are energetic and popular individuals who will liven up the social life of the couple, and keep many new experiences on the horizon."
ESFP,"The XXXX's 'go with the flow', fun-loving attitude will extend to the raising of their children. They are warm and affectionate parents, and are great for giving practical care to their children. They like to do things in a Big way, and enjoy big families."
ESFP,"The XXXX will freely give love and affection to their children, but they frequently have a problem with defining a structured, orderly environment for them, and they may rely on their mates in this regard. Ultimately, the XXXX likely believes that too much structure is not a healthy thing for anyone, and so they're unlikely to enforce a highly structured or disciplined environment. If this trait is strongly present in the XXXX, and is not counteracted by their mate's perspective, it could be considered a potential pitfall for the XXXX parent. Children need some structure which can be depended upon as they grow up."
ESFP,"The XXXX is very practical and concrete in their daily needs, and are usually quite good at taking care of their children's daily needs. Although their approach to life is frequently 'ad-lib', and their lives are almost always extremely full of exciting events, the XXXX is very good at juggling many things at once, which makes them especially good at handling the various issues which come up in a large family."
ESFP,"They tend to have difficulty with the authoritarian role, preferring to be their children's friend. However, they do expect to be given respect and to be obeyed when necessary, and will fall into the role of parental authoritarian at times. This can be frustrating for some children, especially those with strong Judging tendencies, as they will not know what to expect from their XXXX parent."
ESFP,"They are usually remembered fondly by their children for being fun-loving, upbeat, and affectionate, although somewhat scattered."
ESFP,"They are highly enthusiastic and effervescent. They are usually very popular, because people are naturally drawn towards them. They get such genuine delight and enjoyment from experiences which they encounter in life, and they love nothing better than to draw a crowd of people along with them for the sheer fun of it. They try to turn every day into a party, and they're usually successful at doing so."
ESFP,"They are highly valued for their ability to have a good time, and for their genuine warmth and interest towards people. They are extremely in tune with their five senses, and may be prone to overload them with too much alcohol, food, or drugs. They get along with all sorts of people, although they're not interested in spending time with people who they find boring, or who expect the XXXX to communicate with them on an Intuitive or Thinking level. Some people may disapprove of the XXXX's fun-oriented lifestyle. Others may be put off by their very stright-forward and blunt speaking style. The XXXX is likely to especially enjoy spending time with other Extraverts who have the Feeling preference, although they may have a special place in their hearts for people of any preference."
ESFP,"They can't help but spontaneously grasp the moment, particularly if it offers a new sensation or experience. And while the XXXX might seem to others to only be interested in piling up new experiences, or reliving old ones just to savour the quality of the sensations or lively enjoyment they bring, the XXXX has in fact a far more subtle relationship to life and the world around them. Indeed, with their curious mixture of Extraverted Sensation and Xx, the XXXX can show a wealth of complexity in their ways, even if to the XXXX themselves, considering such matters is felt to be a tedious and - to their way of seeing the world - quite unnecessary task. For this reason, just defining what success means to an XXXX requires more than simply assuming that a life filled with satisfying, quality experiences necessarily fulfills this criteria, as the XXXX's true needs and satisfactions will depend greatly on the strength and refinement of their Sensation and Feeling functions. But there is one thing that defines all XXXX's, and that is their exuberant abilty - and need - to engage with other people and express that which grips them. So, whilst success might come through many different paths, and be felt by the XXXX in modes and preferences not necessarily understood as success by other types, the successful XXXX will nevertheless always be found where they can live in full and open engagement with people and able to express their talents, appreciations and joys before the world at large."
ESFP,"great ability to understand the objective world, its facts and realities A talent for entertaining and pleasing others with words and actions An aptitude for getting the most out of any situation or place Very skilled at finding the best of things for themselves and others A warm and generous attitude both as a giver and receiver Exceptional natural musical and dramatic skills A detailed and finely nuanced appreciation of the outside world Adept at detecting and recognising the effects of minute changes to their environment A talent for learning to do practically anything by just watching and doing A reassuring and practical sense of the world which supports others"
ESFP,"Their refined tastes will make it a joy for others to be in their company and homes. Their abilty to weigh the value of their actions gives great force to their talent for entertaining people of all tastes. They will quickly differentiate between those things which are of greater and lesser importance to a situation. They will not just seek entertainment and things for their own sake, but will seek always to find that which they feel will provide the most value and reward for themselves and others. The XXXX who augments their ability to recognize opportunities (Xx) with a strong internal value system (Intoverted Feeling) will find themselves more likely to attract, and be attracted into, very rewarding relationships with others - particularly with those of the opposite sex. They will recognise and promote the talents of others. They can be counted on to defend the best and most life promoting aspects of the world."
ESFP,"They are kind and creative beings with many special gifts. I would like for the XXXX to keep in mind some of the many positive things associated with being an XXXX as they read some of this more negative material. Also remember that the weaknesses associated with being an XXXX are natural to your type. Although it may be depressing to read about your type's weaknesses, please remember that we offer this information to enact positive change. We want people to grow into their own potential, and to live happy and successful lives."
ESFP,"May be seen by others as unnecessarily coarse in their behaviour and life choices. May be unable to value or may ignore the preferences and needs of others. May perceive even the most careful and objective criticism as simply a ploy to spoil their enjoyment of life. May have skewed or unrealistic ideas about the feelings of others. May be unable to acknowledge or hear anything that would lead to second thoughts or a more careful appreciation. May blame their problems on the world at large, seeing themselves as frustrated heroes battling against the odds. May become totally self-focused and oblivious to the havoc they wreak on others feelings. May uncaringly use totally innapropriate social behavior simply to make a point. May be overbearing in their judgements upon the taste and dress of others. May come across to others as boastful and rash in their attitudes. May rationalise the ways of the world in the most inane or simplistic ways. May believe the most extraordinary things about inanimate objects and their workings. May feel overwhelmed with tension and stress when driven into a situation which requires deep and careful consideration. Under great stress, may feel the world around them is alive with dark, unseen influences."
ESFP,"Another difficulty, which is not so much a problem for the XXXX but for those around them, particularly if Xx or Intuitive types, is that even when joyful or in the midst of life, they may be percieved as coldly self absorbed and oblivious to the feelings of others, even when the truth is quite the reverse. Should it somehow matter, then when in the company of such people, the XXXX should take some trouble to express their feelings and value judgements."
ESFP,"Nearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be attributed in various degrees to the common XXXX problem of being overly absorbed by the sensations and immediate apparent facts of the external world. They are usually very spontaneous and outgoing people who have little time for analysis of the complexities behind the world they live in. They are likely to treat any point of view other than their own rather shortly, waving away in particular the more intellectual and intuitive understandings of others as irrelevant and totally secondary to the obvious realities of life. If the XXXX does not learn how to deal with the tension that arises between, what to them, is the most obvious and satisfying way to deal with the world, and those deeper intricacies which lie behind its facade, the XXXX will begin to shut out any incoming information which produces this tension. This is a natural survival technique for the XXXX personality. The main driver to the XXXX personality is Extraverted Sensation, whose purpose is solely to perceive the realities of the external world and by which the XXXX orients themselves towards the things they need or desire. If an XXXX's image of the world is threatened by demands for careful judgement or reasoning, the XXXX shuts out the demand in order to preserve and honor their world view. This is totally natural, and works well to protect the individual psyche from getting hurt. However, the XXXX who exercises this type of self-protection regularly will become not only more and more careless of other people's needs and perspectives, but also cut off in a world where the facts and realities which they perceive become interwoven with a belief system which supports only the They desire driven view. Under such circumstances they will justify their own inappropriate behaviors in the most astounding or rationally simplistic ways, and will always find fault with others for trying to complicate and disturb what ought to be a simple and obvious way of life. It will be difficult for them to maintain close personal relationships because they will not only have unreasonable and simplistically concrete expectations, but will be unable to understand why such expectations cannot be easily met."
ESFP,"Its not an uncommon tendency for the XXXX to look to their inner world only for feelings that justify their desires and perceptions. However, if this tendency is given free reign, the resulting XXXX personality is too self-centered to be happy or successful. Since the XXXX's dominant function is Xx, they must balance this with an auxiliary Xx function which is sufficiently refined to make reasonably objective judgements about the value of the They actions and the people and things in their life. The XXXX makes value judgements via Xx. This is also the XXXX's primary way of dealing with their own internal subjective world. If the XXXX uses Xx only to serve the purposes of Xx, then the XXXX is not using Introversion effectively at all. As a result, the XXXX does sufficiently consider the effects of their actions and perceptions sufficiently for a strong value system to arise in their personality. They see nothing but the joys, satisfactions and sensations of the world outside themselves, and deal with feeling only so far as it supports their need for constant stimulation and gratification. These individuals can often come across as coarse and lustful, although can just as easily seem the complete opposite, as refined and tasteful connoisseurs who, nevertheless, at closer quarters reveal their complete indifference to anything but the satisfaction of their own desires."
ESFP,"At this point, I would like the reader to understand that, as with all personality types, serious problems are usually only encountered by those whose dominant function is unusually strongly expressed against the other functions. Such situations are rare and although the problems discussed here can indeed be felt to some level by all They, most people regardless of their personality type tend toward a balance within both their personal and worldly relationships which occurs despite differences in personality preference; a balance driven by the need for comfort in others and the human capacity for love. So whilst it is essential for us to fine tune our relationships through knowledge and understanding of our differences and peculiar needs, it is also good for us to remember that the most simple and childlike longings of the heart can also be most powerful guides to happiness."
ESFP,"To grow as an individual, the XXXX needs to focus on increasing their self understanding to allow a rational and more objectively reasoned value system to arise within themselves. In order for the XXXX to more validly judge the the value of their desires, actions and the things they allow into their world, the XXXX needs to know that their world view is not being threatened but qualitatively reinforced by the strength and objectivity of their judgements. The XXXX must consciously tell himself/herself that a feeling that does not agree with their desires or perceptions of the world is not an indictment of their character but a clue to greater understanding."
ESFP,"The XXXX who is concerned with personal growth will pay close attention to their motivation for valuing certain actions, interests and possessions over others. Do they attend to their feelings to judge such things according to a strong set of values which accords also with the needs of others? Or, do they judge only to support a personal desire? At the moment when something is felt, is the XXXX concerned with adjusting that feeling to fit in with what appears to them as the most important things in the world? Or is she/he concerned with allowing their feelings to be fully realised? To achieve a better understanding of their feelings, the XXXX should try to allow feelings their full force, before setting them against their strong desires. They should be consciously aware of their tendency to discard anything that doesn't agree with their immediate sense of appearance, and work towards lessening this tendency. They should try to see situations from other people's perspectives, without making personal judgments about the situations or the other people's perspectives. In general, they should work on exercising their Feeling in a truly Introverted sense. In other words, they should use Feeling to understand how the world of their perceptions affects their inner life, using it to discover the values that truly matter, rather than simply to support their wishes. The XXXX who successfully creates a strong value system can be quite a powerful force for positive change."
ESFP,"Some They have difficulty fitting into our society. Their problems are often a result of an uncaring attitude to anything other than the moment, an unawareness of the needs of others, or too simplistic a set of expectations. All of these issues stem from using Xx in a diminished manner. An XXXX who uses feeling to judge the value of their perceptions and actions, rather than one who uses it only to support their desires, will have a clearer, more refined appreciation of the world and what it can offer. He or she will also be more aware of how others may feel, and will have more realistic expectations for others' behavior within a relationship. Such well-adjusted They will fit happily into our society."
ISFP,"As an XXXX, your primary mode of living is focused internally, where you deal with things according to how you feel about them, or how they fit into your value system. Your secondary mode is external, where you take things in via your five sense in a literal, concrete fashion."
ISFP,"They live in the world of sensation possibilities. They are keenly in tune with the way things look, taste, sound, feel and smell. They have a strong aesthetic appreciation for art, and are likely to be artists in some form, because they are unusually gifted at creating and composing things which will strongly affect the senses. They have a strong set of values, which they strive to consistently meet in their lives. They need to feel as if they're living their lives in accordance with what they feel is right, and will rebel against anything which conflicts with that goal. They're likely to choose jobs and careers which allow them the freedom of working towards the realization of their value-oriented personal goals."
ISFP,"They tend to be quiet and reserved, and difficult to get to know well. They hold back their ideas and opinions except from those who they are closest to. They are likely to be kind, gentle and sensitive in their dealings with others. They are interested in contributing to people's sense of well-being and happiness, and will put a great deal of effort and energy into tasks which they believe in."
ISFP,"They have a strong affinity for aesthetics and beauty. They're likely to be animal lovers, and to have a true appreciation for the beauties of nature. They're original and independent, and need to have personal space. They value people who take the time to understand the XXXX, and who support the XXXX in pursuing their goals in their own, unique way. People who don't know them well may see their unique way of life as a sign of carefree light-heartedness, but the XXXX actually takes life very seriously, constantly gathering specific information and shifting it through their value systems, in search for clarification and underlying meaning."
ISFP,"They are action-oriented individuals. They are 'doers', and are usually uncomfortable with theorizing concepts and ideas, unless they see a practical application. They learn best in a 'hands-on' environment, and consequently may become easily bored with the traditional teaching methods, which emphasize abstract thinking. They do not like impersonal analysis, and are uncomfortable with the idea of making decisions based strictly on logic. Their strong value systems demand that decisions are evaluated against their subjective beliefs, rather than against some objective rules or laws."
ISFP,"They are extremely perceptive and aware of others. They constantly gather specific information about people, and seek to discover what it means. They are usually penetratingly accurate in their perceptions of others."
ISFP,"They are warm and sympathetic. They genuinely care about people, and are strongly service-oriented in their desire to please. They have an unusually deep well of caring for those who are close to them, and are likely to show their love through actions, rather than words."
ISFP,"They have no desire to lead or control others, just as they have no desire to be led or controlled by others. They need space and time alone to evaluate the circumstances of their life against their value system, and are likely to respect other people's needs for the same."
ISFP,"The XXXX is likely to not give themself enough credit for the things which they do extremely well. Their strong value systems can lead them to be intensely perfectionist, and cause them to judge themselves with unneccesary harshness."
ISFP,"The XXXX has many special gifts for the world, especially in the areas of creating artistic sensation, and selflessly serving others. Life is not likely to be extremely easy for the XXXX, because they take life so seriously, but they have the tools to make their lives and the lives of those close to them richly rewarding experiences. . Keen awareness of their environment. Live in the present moment. Enjoy a slower pace - they like to take time to savor the present moment. Dislike dealing with theory or abstract thought, unless they see a practical application. Faithful and loyal to people and ideas that are important to them. Individualistic, having no desire to lead or follow. Take things seriously, although they frequently appear not to. Special bond with children and animals. Quiet and reserved, except with people they know extremely well. Trusting, sensitive, and kind. Service-oriented; they're driven to help others. Extremely well-developed appreciation for aesthetic beauty. Likely to be original and unconventional. Learn best with hands-on training. Hate being confined to strict schedules and regimens. Need space and freedom to do things their own way. Dislike mundane, routine tasks, but will perform them if necessary "
ISFP,"The XXXX is a very special individual who needs to have a career that is more than a job. The middle of the road is not likely to be a place where they will be fulfilled and happy. They need to have a career that is consistent with their strong core of inner values. Since they prefer to live in the current moment, and take the time to savor it, they do not do well with some of the more fast-paced corporate environments. They need a great deal of space and freedom if they are going to function in their natural realm of acute sensory awareness. If they give free reign to their natural abilities, they may find a wonderful artist within themselves. Almost every major artist in the world has been an XXXX. Since the XXXX is so acutely aware of people's feelings and reactions, and is driven by their inner values to help people, the XXXX is also a natural counselor and teacher. . Artist. Musician. Designer. Child Care. Social Worker. Counselor. Teacher. Psychologist. Veterinarian. Forest Ranger. Pediatrician"
ISFP,"They are warmhearted, gentle people who take their commitments seriously, and seek lifelong relationships. They are very private people, who keep their true feelings and opinions reserved or hidden from others. This may cause them to constantly defer to their mates in their intimate relationships, which may cause problems if their mates are not extremely aware of the XXXX's feelings. Some They who are in the habit of not expressing their needs and feelings find themselves in situations throughout their life where they feel overshadowed, overlooked, or even 'tread upon' by others. Highly practical and cynical by nature, these feelings may cause the XXXX to become bitter, and to either give up on their relationships, or to start using their relationships for their own personal gain. Although this problem is observed sometimes in the XXXX type, it does not seem to be present in those They who consistently express their feelings to those closest to them. These They have a very positive, warm outlook on life and love, and are not as likely to find themselves in relationships where they are taken for granted or taken advantage of. They go to great lengths to please their partners. They're very loyal and supportive, with a deep capacity for love. They detest conflict and discord, and highly value being seen and understood for who they are. They need space to live their lives in their own unique way, and will respect other's need for space. . Warm, friendly and affirming by nature. Usually optimistic. Good listeners. Good at dealing with practical day-to-day concerns. Flexible and laid-back, usually willing to defer to their mates. Their love of aesthetic beauty and appreciation for function makes them likely to have attractive, functional homes. Take their commitments seriously, and seek lifelong relationships. Likely to value and respect other's personal space. Likely to enjoy showing their affection through acts and deeds. Sensuous and earthy . Not good at long-range financial (or other) planning. Extreme dislike of conflict and criticism. Focused on enjoying the present moment, they may appear lazy or slow-moving at times. Need to have their own space, and dislike having it invaded. May be slow to show their affection with words. Tendency to hold back their thoughts and feelings, unless drawn out. May become overly cynical and practical "
ISFP,"They are warm and giving people, who have a depth of emotion and caring which is not often obvious to others, except those who know them extremely well. They are usually intense people, who experience their emotions on an intense level. Although they may appear to be light-hearted, they are in fact extremely serious, and take their relationships seriously. Unlike other XXXX types, people with the XXXX type desire and seek lifelong, committed relationships."
ISFP,"They may have a problem with communication. With Xx dominating their personality, they are more vulnerable then most to being hurt. Perhaps because of this, they tend to hold back part of themselves from others, and do not always say what they think or feel. This is especially true during conflict situations, which the XXXX abhors more than anything in the world. Confrontations and arguments are very difficult for the XXXX to deal with. They feel personally threatened in these situations. If the XXXX falls into the habit of not communicating their feelings with their partner, this could cause serious problems in the relationship over the long haul."
ISFP,"Sexually, the XXXX approaches intimacy with complete attention, seriousness and depth. They experience lovemaking through their senses, and welcome the chance to interact with their mate at this level. They are not likely to express their feelings verbally, believing that actions speak louder than words."
ISFP,"They need positive affirmation to be happy and feel good about themselves. They need to be praised, although they are usually uncomfortable with 'gushy' praise. The greatest gift their partners can give them is the expression of their affection and admiration."
ISFP,"They enjoy their parenting role, and take great pride and comfort in their children. Most have a special affinity with babies and young children, and form bonds with their children when they are very young. They are very laid-back parents, and are not likely to have highly defined expectations of their children. They will gently guide their behavior, and suggest a particular direction, but their own respect of the individual psyche will cause them to be quite easy-going and non-demanding as parents. The XXXX is likely to treat their children as individuals, and encourage them to have their own role in the family."
ISFP,"They love to have fun, and live in the current moment. All They have a bit of little kid inside themselves, and they love to play games alongside their children. They're special affinity towards nature and animals makes them likely to lead their children in fun outdoors activities."
ISFP,"They are not likely to provide a very structured environment for their children. They are also likely to have a problem with disciplining or punishing their kids. The gentle manner and kind heart of the XXXX makes it hard for them to make others unhappy - especially their own children. However, structure and discipline are important for growing children. If the other parent encourages and promotes structure, and is able to administer discipline when necessary, the parent combination may work very well without there being an obvious lack of structure. However, if the other parent is also not strong with structure or discipline, this is an area which needs to have special attention. Growing children do not have the experience to decide on their own the difference between Right and Wrong. They need to have barriers set down in a tangible way, to help them decide."
ISFP,"They like to show their love in deeds rather than words, which is manifested in their doing a lot for their children. They may lavish them with gifts on Christmas day, or go out of their way to do special things for them."
ISFP,"The XXXX is a service-oriented person, who defines their personal worth in some part by how happy they make others. This is typical of people with the Feeling preference. The special potential problem that They face is their service-oriented attitude combined with their habit of not expressing their own needs and feelings. This combination causes some They to get taken for granted. If this happens frequently to an XXXX, they may become bitter and angry. They think of themselves as victims, and may erect barriers to keep out those who have hurt them. This may be a serious problem if the XXXX parent feels that their children are taking them for granted. The best defense against such a situation occuring is for the XXXX to get into the habit of verbalizing and communicating their needs."
ISFP,"XXXX parents will be loyal, dedicated and self-sacrificing to their children until they leave home. When the kids have left the nest, the XXXX will enjoy their time alone to do things for themself. If the XXXX has not allowed themselves to become victims or victimizers in their life, they will be very good parents, and will be remembered fondly and affectionately by their children."
ISFP,"They are able to get along with most of the other personality types, although they tend to be reserved around those they don't know well. They will enjoy spending time with others who share their interests, and who understand and accept the XXXX for who they are. They greatly value their space and autonomy, and appreciate other's respect for that."
ISFP,"The XXXX is not likely to have much patience or tolerance for those who are strongly Judging. They celebrate their own uniqueness, as well as everybody else's, and don't appreciate being judged harshly for their differences."
ISFP,"In work settings, the XXXX is likely to get along with most everyone, unless someone inhabits their space too much, in which case sparks may fly. Generally, the XXXX is kind-hearted and generous with those they care about, and makes a true-blue friend."
ISFP,"They are creative, sensitive souls with a great capacity for love. They seek harmony, validation, and affection in their relationships with others. They value creativity and spirituality. Very sensitive and easily hurt by rejection and harshness, they are sometimes drawn to turn their love towards creatures who will love them back unconditionally, such as animals and small chlidren. They believe heartily in unconditional love, and in an individual's right to be themself without being judged harshly for who they are. Of all of the types, the XXXX is most likely to believe that 'Love is the answer.' For the XXXX, personal success depends upon the condition of their closest relationships, their aesthetic environment and the development of their artistic creativity, their spiritual development, and how much they feel valued and accepted for their individual contributions."
ISFP,"Highly creative, artistic and spiritual, they can produce wonderful works of art, music and literature. They are natural artists. They will find great satisfaction if they encourage and develop their artistic abilities. That doesn't mean that an XXXX has to be a famous writer or painter in order to be content. Simply the act of 'creating' will be a fulfilling source of renewal and refreshment to the XXXX. An XXXX should allow himself or herself some artistic outlet, because it will add enrichment and positive energy to their life. They're more spiritually aware than most people, and are more in touch with their soul than others. Most They have strong Faith. Those that don't may feel as if they're missing something important. An XXXX should nourish their faith. They have an extremely well-developed ability to appreciate aesthetic qualities. They're usually very aware of their environment, and can easily see what works well and what doesn't from an aesthetic perspective. If they allow this strength to flourish, they're likely to be stylish dressers who live in a home that's aesthetically pleasing. They have passionate and intense feelings. They are very quick-witted and spatial in their thinking. If they have the desire, they can be very good at individual sports like golf, skiing, biking, etc., because they're extremely observant and have quick reactions. They're usually good listeners who genuinely want to hear about someone's problems, and genuinely want to help them. This makes them outstanding counsellors, and good friends. An XXXX may find great satisfaction from volunteering as a counselor. They accept and value people as individuals, and are strongly egalitarian. They believe that an individual has the right to be themself, without having their attitudes and perspectives brought under scrutiny. Accordingly, they have a great deal of tolerance and acceptance dealing with people who might encounter negative judgment from society in general. They can see something positive in everyone. They believe in individuals. If they give themselves the opportunity, an XXXX can become a much-needed source of self-esteem and confidence for people who cannot find it on their own. In this way, they can nurture a 'sick soul' back to health. Practical and detail-oriented, They are great at handling the details of a project. They live for the current day, and have an ability to enjoy the present moment without stressing out about the future or the past. They have a good ability to concentrate and focus. Accordingly, they can do well in school if they set their mind to it."
ISFP,"Their strongly passionate nature combined with their natural sense of aesthetic beauty may make them gifted artists (such as Picasso, or Barbra Streisand, both reportedly They). Their awareness of what's going on around them combined with their great capacity to love will make them outstanding parents and caregivers. They will quickly identify the opportunities of a situation, and quickly act to take advantage of them. They will find that they're able to do anything that they put their mind to, although they may not find it personally satisfying. Things may seem to come easily to these They. Although they're able to conquer many different kinds of tasks and situations, these They will be happiest doing something that seems truly important to them. Although they may find that they can achieve the 'mainstream' type of success with relative ease, they are not likely to find happiness along that path, unless they have especially rich and rewarding personal relationships. The XXXX who augments their strong, internal value system (Xx) with a well-developed ability to recognize opportunities (Xx) can be a powerful force for social change."
ISFP,"They are kind and creative beings with many special gifts. I would like for the XXXX to keep in mind some of the many positive things associated with being an XXXX as they read some of this more negative material. Also remember that the weaknesses associated with being an XXXX are natural to your type. Although it may be depressing to read about your type's weaknesses, please remember that we offer this information to enact positive change. We want people to grow into their own potential, and to live happy and successful lives."
ISFP,"May be extremely sensitive to any kind of criticism May be unable to see the opportunities inherent to a situation May perceive criticism where none was intended May have skewed or unrealistic ideas about reality May be unable to acknowledge or hear anything that goes against their personal ideas and opinions May blame their problems on other people, seeing themselves as victims who are treated unfairly May have great anger, and show this anger with rash outpourings of bad temper May be unaware of appropriate social behavior May be oblivious to their personal appearance, or to appropriate dress May come across as eccentric, or perhaps even generally strange to others, without being aware of it May be unable to see or understand anyone else's point of view May value their own opinions and feelings far above others May be unaware of how their behavior affects others May be oblivious to other people's need May feel overwhelmed with tension and stress when someone expresses disagreement with the XXXX, or disapproval of the XXXX May develop strong judgments that are difficult to unseed against people who they perceive have been oppressive or suppressive to them Under great stress, may feel out of control and fearful, dwelling on the 'dark side' of things"
ISFP,"Nearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be attributed in various degrees to the common XXXX problem of only taking in data that justifies their personal opinions. They are usually very intense and sensitive people, and feel seriously threatened by criticism. They are likely to treat any point of view other than their own as criticism of their own perspective. If the XXXX does not learn how to deal with this perceived criticism, the XXXX will begin to shut out the incoming information that causes them pain. This is a natural survivalistic technique for the XXXX personality. The main driver to the XXXX personality is Xx, whose purpose is to maintain and honor an intensely personal system of values and morals. If an XXXX's personal value system is threatened by external influences, the XXXX shuts out the threatening data in order to preserve and honor their value system. This is totally natural, and works well to protect the individual psyche from getting hurt. However, the XXXX who exercises this type of self-protection regularly will become more and more unaware of other people's perspectives, and thus more and more isolated from a real understanding of the world that they live in. They will always find justification for their own inappropriate behaviors, and will always find fault with the external world for problems that they have in their lives. It will be difficult for them to maintain close personal relationships because they will have unreasonable expectations, and will be unable to accept blame."
ISFP,"Its not an uncommon tendency for the XXXX to look to the external world primarily for information that will support their ideas and values. However, if this tendency is given free reign, the resulting XXXX personality is too self-centered to be happy or successful. Since the XXXX's dominant function to their personality is Xx, they must balance this with an auxiliary Xx function. The XXXX takes in information via Xx. This is also the XXXX's primary way of dealing with the external world. If the XXXX uses Xx only to serve the purposes of Xx, then the XXXX is not using Extraversion effectively at all. As a result, the XXXX does not take in enough information about the external world to have a good sense of what's going on. They see nothing but their own perspective, and deal with the world only so far as they need to in order to support their perspective. These individuals usually come across as selfish and unrealistic. Depending on how serious the problem is, they may appear to be anything from 'a bit eccentric' to 'way out there'. Many times other people are unable to understand or relate to these people."
ISFP,"To grow as an individual, the XXXX needs to focus on opening their perspective to include a more accurate picture of what is really going on in the world. In order to be in a position in which the XXXX is able to perceive and consider data that is foreign to their internal value system, the XXXX needs to know that its value system is not threatened by the new information. The XXXX must consciously tell himself/herself that an opinion that does not concede with their own is not an indictment of their entire character."
ISFP,"The XXXX who is concerned with personal growth will pay close attention to their motivation for taking in information. Do they take in information to better understand a situation or concept? Or, do they take in information to support a personal idea or cause? At the moment when something is perceived, is the XXXX concerned with twisting that perception to fit in with their personal values? Or is she/he concerned with absorbing the information objectively? To achieve a better understanding of the external world, the XXXX should try to perceive information objectively, before fitting it into their value system. They should consciously be aware of their tendency to discard anything that doesn't agree with their values, and work towards lessening this tendency. They should try to see situations from other people's perspectives, without making personal judgments about the situations or the other people's perspectives. In general, they should work on exercising their Sensing in a truly Extraverted sense. In other words, they should use Sensing to take in information about the world around them for the sake of understanding the world, rather than take in information to support their own conclusions. The XXXX who successfully perceives things objectively may be quite a powerful force for positive change."
ISFP,"Some They have difficulty fitting into our society. Their problems are often a result of an unawareness of appropriate social behavior, an unawareness of how they come across to others, or unrealistic expectations of others. Any one of these three issues stem from using Xx in a diminished manner. An XXXX who takes in information for the sake of understanding the world around them, rather than one who takes in information only to support their own ideas, will have a clearer, more objective understanding of how society values social behaviors and attitudes. He or she will also be more aware of how they are perceived by others, and will have more realistic expectations for others' behavior within a relationship. Such well-adjusted They will fit happily into our society."
ENTJ,"As an XXXX, your primary mode of living is focused externally, where you deal with things rationally and logically. Your secondary mode is internal, where you take things in primarily via your intuition."
ENTJ,"They are natural born leaders. They live in a world of possibilities where they see all sorts challenges to be surmounted, and they want to be the ones responsible for surmounting them. They have a drive for leadership, which is well-served by their quickness to grasp complexities, their ability to absorb a large amount of impersonal information, and their quick and decisive judgments. They are 'take charge' people."
ENTJ,"They are very career-focused, and fit into the corporate world quite naturally. They are constantly scanning their environment for potential problems which they can turn into solutions. They generally see things from a long-range perspective, and are usually successful at identifying plans to turn problems around - especially problems of a corporate nature. They are usually successful in the business world, because they are so driven to leadership. They're tireless in their efforts on the job, and driven to visualize where an organization is headed. For these reasons, they are natural corporate leaders."
ENTJ,"There is not much room for error in the world of the XXXX. They dislike to see mistakes repeated, and have no patience with inefficiency. They may become quite harsh when their patience is tried in these respects, because they are not naturally tuned in to people's feelings, and more than likely don't believe that they should tailor their judgments in consideration for people's feelings. They, like many types, have difficulty seeing things from outside their own perspective. Unlike other types, They naturally have little patience with people who do not see things the same way as the XXXX. The XXXX needs to consciously work on recognizing the value of other people's opinions, as well as the value of being sensitive towards people's feelings. In the absence of this awareness, the XXXX will be a forceful, intimidating and overbearing individual. This may be a real problem for the XXXX, who may be deprived of important information and collaboration from others. In their personal world, it can make some They overbearing as spouses or parents."
ENTJ,"The XXXX has a tremendous amount of personal power and presence which will work for them as a force towards achieving their goals. However, this personal power is also an agent of alienation and self-aggrandizement, which the XXXX would do well to avoid."
ENTJ,"They are very forceful, decisive individuals. They make decisions quickly, and are quick to verbalize their opinions and decisions to the rest of the world. The XXXX who has not developed their Intuition will make decisions too hastily, without understanding all of the issues and possible solutions. On the other hand, an XXXX who has not developed their Thinking side will have difficulty applying logic to their insights, and will often make poor decisions. In that case, they may have brilliant ideas and insight into situations, but they may have little skill at determining how to act upon their understanding, or their actions may be inconsistent. An XXXX who has developed in a generally less than ideal way may become dictatorial and abrasive - intrusively giving orders and direction without a sound reason for doing so, and without consideration for the people involved."
ENTJ,"Although They are not naturally tuned into other people's feelings, these individuals frequently have very strong sentimental streaks. Often these sentiments are very powerful to the XXXX, although they will likely hide it from general knowledge, believing the feelings to be a weakness. Because the world of feelings and values is not where the XXXX naturally functions, they may sometimes make value judgments and hold onto submerged emotions which are ill-founded and inappropriate, and will cause them problems - sometimes rather serious problems."
ENTJ,"They love to interact with people. As Extroverts, they're energized and stimulated primarily externally. There's nothing more enjoyable and satisfying to the XXXX than having a lively, challenging conversation. They especially respect people who are able to stand up to the XXXX, and argue persuasively for their point of view. There aren't too many people who will do so, however, because the XXXX is a very forceful and dynamic presence who has a tremendous amount of self-confidence and excellent verbal communication skills. Even the most confident individuals may experience moments of self-doubt when debating a point with an XXXX."
ENTJ,"They want their home to be beautiful, well-furnished, and efficiently run. They're likely to place much emphasis on their children being well-educated and structured, to desire a congenial and devoted relationship with their spouse. At home, the XXXX needs to be in charge as much as he or she does in their career. The XXXX is likely best paired with someone who has a strong self-image, who is also a Thinking type. Because the XXXX is primarily focused on their careers, some They have a problem with being constantly absent from home, physically or mentally."
ENTJ,"The XXXX has many gifts which make it possible for them to have a great deal of personal power, if they don't forget to remain balanced in their lives. They are assertive, innovative, long-range thinkers with an excellent ability to translate theories and possibilities into solid plans of action. They are usually tremendously forceful personalities, and have the tools to accomplish whatever goals they set out for. . Driven to turn theories into plans. Highly value knowledge. Future-oriented. Natural leaders. Impatient with inefficiency and incompetence. Want things structured and orderly. Excellent verbal communication skills. Dislike routine, detail-oriented tasks. Self-confident. Decisive "
ENTJ,"They are especially well-suited to be leaders and organization builders. They have the ability to clearly identify problems and innovative solutions for the short and long-term well-being of an organization. Having a strong desire to lead, they're not likely to be happy as followers. They like to be in charge, and need to be in charge to take advantage of their special capabilities. . Business Executive. Organization Builder. Entrepreneur. Computer Consultant. Lawyer. Judge. Business Administrator. Business Manager. University Professor"
ENTJ,"They put a lot of effort and enthusiasm into their relationships. Since their major quest in life is to constantly take in knowledge and turn that into something useful, the XXXX will try to turn everything into a learning experience. Within the context of relationships, that means they will constantly seek knowledge and revise the rules and definitions of their relationships. They value their relationships highly, especially those relationships which present them with new challenges and stimulate their learning. Such exchanges promote genuine affection and satisfaction for the XXXX. Relationships which do not offer any chances for growth or learning hold no interest to the XXXX. As in other areas of life, the XXXX likes to be in charge of their relationships. In conversation, they are very direct and confrontational, and can be highly critical and challenging towards others. People involved in close relationships with the XXXX need to have a good amount of personal strength. For those who do, the XXXX has a tremendous amount to offer. . Genuinely interested in people's ideas and thoughts. Enthusiastic and energetic. Take their commitments very seriously. Fair-minded and interested in doing the Right Thing. Very good with money. Extremely direct and straightforward. Verbally fluent. Enhance and encourage knowledge and self-growth in all aspects of life. Able to leave relationships without looking back. Able to turn conflict situations into positive lessons. Able to take constructive criticism well. Extremely high standards and expectations (both a strength and a weakness). Usually have strong affections and sentimental streaks. Able to dole out discipline . Their enthusiasm for verbal debates can make them appear argumentative. Tendency to be challenging and confrontational. Tend to get involved in 'win-lose' conversations. Tendency to have difficulty listening to others. Tendency to be critical of opinions and attitudes which don't match their own. Extremely high standards and expectations (both a strength and a weakness). Not naturally in tune with people's feelings and reactions. May have difficulty expressing love and affection, sometimes seeming awkward or inappropriate. Can be overpowering and intimidating to others. Tendency to want to always be in charge, rather than sharing responsibilities. Can be very harsh and intolerant about messiness or inefficiency. Tendency to be controlling. May be slow to give praise or to realize another's need for praise. If unhappy or underdeveloped, they may be very impersonal, dictatorial, or abrasive. Tendency to make hasty decisions. Make explode with terrible tempers when under extreme stress "
ENTJ,"They make aggressive, enthusiastic partners who take their commitments very seriously. As in other aspects of their life, they want to be the leader in the relationship, and take on responsibility for making things work. The are creative leaders, and are likely to have relationships which promote constant growth and learning. Since they are constantly scanning the environment for new ideas and things worth learning, the XXXX may frequently re-define the 'rules' of the relationship, although their commitment remains constant. If it becomes very clear to them that the relationship no longer offers any chance of growth or learning, the XXXX will leave the situation, and not look back."
ENTJ,"They are usually very successful in their careers, and usually very good with money. This is helpful in that it may remove a lot of the conflict which couples generate over money matters, but it may become a problem if the XXXX is too much of a workaholic to spend time on the growth and development of the relationship."
ENTJ,"The XXXX is not naturally in-tune with the feelings and emotions of their partners. They who allow themselves time to be alone, and develop the introspective 'feeling' side of their natures, will be generally 'softer' individuals, who are more aware of their partners' emotional needs. However, this awareness is almost always a conscious attempt on the part of the XXXX, rather than a naturally occuring characteristic. They who do not make the attempt to be aware of others, and to value their feelings and opinions, may find themselves in unbalanced relationships, where real communication does not take place. These kinds of situations present a two-edged sword to the XXXX. They want to be in charge, but if they become so much in charge as to stifle their partners, they will eventually become bored with the relationship."
ENTJ,"Sexually, the XXXX is robust, imaginative and enthusiastic. Their natural instinct to lead will be apparent in this arena as well as other areas of life, and they will lead their partner on creative lovemaking adventures, where the focus is on mutual learning and affection sharing. They're likely to expect sex on a relatively scheduled basis."
ENTJ,"The XXXX does not usually have a problem with self-confidence and is not especially emotionally needy. Although they enjoy being told that they are loved and appreciated, they don't need to hear these types of avowals as often as most other types. If they are partnered with a Feeling type, they are probably not likely to fulfill their partner's needs for intimate words without conscious effort. Even with effort, the XXXX may have problems being aware of other's emotional needs, and they most likely won't understand those needs even if they are aware of them."
ENTJ,"They approach conflict as an opportunity for growth and learning. This is a very healthy outlook in general, but may be a problem in a close relationship with a Feeling type. Individuals with the Feeling preference generally detest conflict and criticism, and avoid it as one would avoid a deadly snake. The They tendency to be confrontational may be very threatening to a person with a Feeling preference - especially so if they are an intimate partner of the XXXX. An XXXX who has a well-developed Feeling side may work well with a partner with a Feeling preference. Otherwise, They will probably have the most successful intimate relationships with types which prefer the Thinking process naturally, or who are not extremely strong on the Feeling preference."
ENTJ,"In general, the XXXX has a lot to offer to their intimate relationships. They're dedicated and enthusiastic, and willing to put forth a lot of effort to make things work out. They take on responsibility and accountability, and expect to be in charge. Their relationship will be one based on mutual respect, constant growth and development."
ENTJ,"They take their parenting role very seriously. They consider the task of passing on their values and goals to their children as an objective fact - it is something which will be done. They consider it their responsibility to make sure that their child is constantly developing and learning in the most optimal way. The XXXX parent is usually rather strict, and has very high expectations of their children."
ENTJ,"As a parent, the XXXX continuously promotes learning and independent thinking. They pass on their love of knowledge to their children, and challenge them at every turn to thoroughly understand their positions and perspectives. They expect that their children will follow their lead. The XXXX is in charge - there can be no doubt about that. They expect their children to honor their parents, and to follow the rules and procedures which are set forth for the household. There is little room for error in those expectations, and the XXXX will be a harsh parental authoritarian when the rules are broken. The children of an XXXX usually know their place, and have a lot of respect for their XXXX parent."
ENTJ,"During the teen years, we are likely to see a child rebel from their relationship with the XXXX. Although this situation is common with almost all of the types, it is especially true for parents who are Extraverted Judging types. Children growing into adults do not want to be controlled, and adults who are used to controlling their children have a difficult time letting go. The XXXX parent would be wise to 'loosen up' their hold a bit, as long as they can do so without compromising what they feel to be right."
ENTJ,"They who have not given themselves introspective time to develop the feeling side of their nature frequently develop harsh, aggressive tendancies. Such an XXXX parent is prone to be something of a dictator - giving out orders arbitrarily, and expecting them to be followed to a 'T' without any 'back-talk'. If continued over a long span of time, this kind of behavior creates an oppressive environment for the child. An XXXX can address such tendancies by making time for introspection, and remembering to consciously be aware of people's feelings."
ENTJ,"They who have managed to avoid many of the problems associated with their type are wonderful parental figures. They are remembered fondly and valued by their children for challenging them at every turn, and thus promoting growth and development. This type of knowledge seeking usually becomes a life-long habit for their children, who turn into responsible and independent adults."
ENTJ,"They are bright, energetic, sociable individuals who are keenly interested in other people's ideas, theories and perspectives. They love nothing better than to participate in quality conversation with other people who share similar views to their own, or who have something new to teach the XXXX. They make stimulating, interesting, and dynamic friends and peers."
ENTJ,"The XXXX thoroughly enjoys lively, intellectual conversations - welcoming such interaction as a learning opportunity for all parties involved. They have a tendency to be direct and challenging when interacting with others, which tends to put people on the defensive. This is in fact exactly what they're after - the XXXX wants to learn what you know, and understand as many of the nuances of your knowledge as the context of the conversation will allow. They go after this knowledge in a very direct, confrontational manner. With this approach, they will learn not only the facts of the knowledge, but also the background of the individual's stance on that piece of knowledge. How well does the individual understand the topic? How invested is the individual in their stance? This method of 'unsettling' people has the effect of livening up conversations and stimulating learning, when the other conversationalists are able to easily withstand the interrogations of the XXXX. People who are uncomfortable with being challenged, or who are less than confident in the topic being discussed, are likely to be subdued into not expressing themselves with the XXXX. This is a bit of a shame, since many people have valuable things to offer, but are not always willing to stand on top of a mountain and strongly shout their views to the world."
ENTJ,"The XXXX is likely to seek the company of people who have similar views and interests to their own. They have no patience with people who have very different lifestyles and perspectives from their own. However, as individuals with a great deal of personal power, They are highly attracted to interacting with other individuals with a powerful presence. They admire such people, although they may not agree with them. They are likely to form their closer friendships with other iNtuitives - especially Extraverted iNtuitives, such as They, They, They, and They. The XXXX will enjoy the other iNtuitives' stimulating company, who share their enthusiasm for ideas and learning."
ENTJ,"XXXX people are realists, in the most basic sense of the word. Not only because their thinking is based upon a clear view of how things actually are in the world around them, but also because their ideas and strategies are structured around those unambiguous, 'down to earth', commonsense beliefs which sum up the obvious and undeniable in life. But while They might be pragmatic about the immediate situation before them, they are scarcely satisfied with it until it can be made more productive, useful or valuable. The XXXX's reasoning on such matters is always clear and generally unemotional. If action can improve an item or a situation then it ought to be taken, and the XXXX will always be found in the midst of such action, organizing, planning and leading the way forward until the best result possible has been realized. This makes success for an XXXX something that can be clearly seen, a real world result which can be measured. And whether measured in dollars, bricks, bread or just happy people, the successful XXXX knows the result is due to their belief that it is just plain commonsense to try and make the best of every situation and get the most out if it for the most people."
ENTJ,"Able to cut straight to the chase in any situation and not be sidetracked by non-essential issues A propensity for leadership which follows naturally from their ability to control and manage real time/real world situations A talent for factual analysis unbiased by prejudice or emotion. A 'can do' approach to life which makes the working environment a positive place for them A strong regard for positive social and economic institutions, structure and government Second to none time and space management skills, everything is organized and in its place Able to constantly synthesize and adapt new ideas and concepts into strategies for business, social, financial or environmental development"
ENTJ,"talent for creating great benefits through the addressing of social justice issues The ability to recognize and mediate their potentials in accord with the expectations of others An approach to life which includes an awareness of the differences between their needs and those of others Able to know when to stop and take stock of life and recognize the qualities of the moment A talent for showing others the way to get past difficulties in their outer life"
ENTJ,"XXXX's are strong, right minded and rational people. This should be kept in mind as you read some of the more negative material about XXXX weaknesses. These weaknesses are natural. We offer this information to enact positive change, rather than as blatant criticism."
ENTJ,"May be unable to understand other people's needs where these differ from their own. May unwisely assume their ideas are the only right ones and are therefore being fully implemented by others. May become childishly petulant or angered when confronted by situations which require feeling judgments. May become so engrossed in a plan or ambition that personal needs and the needs of others are forgotten. May take every decision not made in agreement with their rational beliefs as a personal rejection. May be easily taken in or manipulated by others via agreement with their rational attitudes. May become obsessed with small obstructions and difficulties to the point where the overall plan is forgotten May believe natural limitations are actually ailments which ought to be eradicated May assume others are ever plotting against May believe only their own view of the world or a situation is correct, even to the point that they make it into a kind of dogma which must be followed by those around them."
ENTJ,"Most of the problems described above can be seen as a direct result of a too dominant Xx function ruling the personality. In most cases this is exactly what is happening, but it is also worth recognizing that some of the weaknesses in the XXXX's personality that are more apparent to other Types, flow not so much from the excesses of the XXXX's dominant function, but from the natural inferiority of their feeling function and its lack of adaptation. We must also recognize that the level of expression of all functions in all people is variable and that some of the problems discussed here apply only to strongly expressing XXXX's, where the attitude which flows from using Xx exclusively to guide them through life creates its own particular problems."
ENTJ,"The over dominance of Xx leads to an intensely intellectual way of seeing the world, where values such as right and wrong, good and bad, useful and useless are judged only by their applicability to an almost mathematically exact - and to the XXXX - always rational, attitude to life. Without the balance provided by other ways of seeing or judging, the XXXX is unable to account for actions based upon the inner views or feeling behavior of others, hence such things are always judged negatively, either as irrelevant - or at best - as being of small consequence. Additionally, with their thinking attitude always turned outward and totally subject to the world beyond their senses, without the balance of some internally felt objectivity the XXXX will often follow their ideas and ambitions without consideration for their own physical and emotional needs. Indeed, the XXXX often feels that if only his project, his work, his outer reality would just fall into line with his own rational views then all would be well within his world and all his needs would be met. Unfortunately such an attitude can never be satisfied, for the world is not only rational, but also full of situations and human behavior which must be appreciated and understood by quite different, and again - to the XXXX - often seemingly absurd criteria."
ENTJ,"Xx is the XXXX's access to their inner world, to the information that could tell them how the world is affecting them. Because it is introverted, its images arise from the subjective depths of the mind, and contain all that the XXXX has not considered within their strictly rational and object oriented view of the world. Xx provides the personally biased information the XXXX needs to balance this world view and protect the XXXX from being totally swallowed up by their selfless and yet single minded attachment to facts, figures and a rationale they accept only from the world outside themselves. Because this inner information is often opposed to the XXXX's strongly held ideas it is often rejected, or if accepted, turned outward to make negative judgments about external situations or the behavior of others, rather than seen as a corrective balance to the XXXX's own attitudes and behavior."
ENTJ,"To grow as an individual, the XXXX needs to recognize the role Intuition plays in their life, and learn to understand its language. In particular the XXXX needs to realize that their intuitive function is not directed outward to the world, that its images are personal, subjective and relate directly to the way the XXXX's inner self is being affected by both the outside world and their own behavior."
ENTJ,"Xx is not an obvious process to understand, and quite unlike the rational, straightforward thinking the XXXX is used to. Nevertheless, if understood and fully utilized to support thinking, it can make the XXXX the most outwardly effective and productive of all the personality types. For this reason it is essential to allow this gift to become what it can be, rather than limiting its talents and allowing it only to speak when it seems to agree with the XXXX's outwardly focused thinking. Below are a few specific suggestions to help you apply Xx."
ENTJ,"Some They have difficulty fitting into our society. Their problems are generally associated with a strongly dogmatic and overly rational approach to life, coupled with an almost total lack of ability to understand the needs of others. Where such a strongly expressing difficulty arises, the XXXX finds themselves constantly embattled by a world which refuses to conform to their ideals and creates situations in which the XXXX is out of their depth. Such situations are often met by the XXXX with such a childish emotionality that others are put off and isolate the XXXX emotionally. Such XXXX's often find themselves without friends, and with business partners or employees who are unwilling to engage the XXXX upon any matter other than strictly task related questions. Such behavior in others only serves to bring out underlying sentiments in the XXXX which, via their badly adapted intuitive function, speak to them of plots, nastiness and covert obstructive behavior on the part of others. Suffice to say, such suspicions and childish sentiments coupled with dogmatic demands to conform to the XXXX's own way of seeing the world can soon destroy families and close relationships."
ENTJ,"It is incumbent upon the XXXX to break the circle of such behavior by allowing their Xx a place in their life. Through attention to this function the XXXX can discover a path to understanding and recognizing the effects not only their own behavior has upon others, but also the greater possibilities which lie within themselves for not only a harmonious relationship with others, but also a greater sense of what might be best for themselves."
ENTJ,"Understanding the feeling needs and judgments of others is not an easy task for the XXXX, but through their Intuitive function they can find images and ideas which - whilst not speaking directly to the feeling judgments of others - might allow them to see outside the strictly rational circle of their world view in such a way as to recognize that there is indeed a different perspective which must be taken account of."
INTJ,"As an XXXX, your primary mode of living is focused internally, where you take things in primarily via your intuition. Your secondary mode is external, where you deal with things rationally and logically."
INTJ,"They live in the world of ideas and strategic planning. They value intelligence, knowledge, and competence, and typically have high standards in these regards, which they continuously strive to fulfill. To a somewhat lesser extent, they have similar expectations of others."
INTJ,"With Xx dominating their personality, They focus their energy on observing the world, and generating ideas and possibilities. Their mind constantly gathers information and makes associations about it. They are tremendously insightful and usually are very quick to understand new ideas. However, their primary interest is not understanding a concept, but rather applying that concept in a useful way. Unlike the XXXX, they do not follow an idea as far as they possibly can, seeking only to understand it fully. They are driven to come to conclusions about ideas. Their need for closure and organization usually requires that they take some action."
INTJ,"XXXX's tremendous value and need for systems and organization, combined with their natural insightfulness, makes them excellent scientists. An XXXX scientist gives a gift to society by putting their ideas into a useful form for others to follow. It is not easy for the XXXX to express their internal images, insights, and abstractions. The internal form of the XXXX's thoughts and concepts is highly individualized, and is not readily translatable into a form that others will understand. However, the XXXX is driven to translate their ideas into a plan or system that is usually readily explainable, rather than to do a direct translation of their thoughts. They usually don't see the value of a direct transaction, and will also have difficulty expressing their ideas, which are non-linear. However, their extreme respect of knowledge and intelligence will motivate them to explain themselves to another person who they feel is deserving of the effort."
INTJ,"They are natural leaders, although they usually choose to remain in the background until they see a real need to take over the lead. When they are in leadership roles, they are quite effective, because they are able to objectively see the reality of a situation, and are adaptable enough to change things which aren't working well. They are the supreme strategists - always scanning available ideas and concepts and weighing them against their current strategy, to plan for every conceivable contingency."
INTJ,"They spend a lot of time inside their own minds, and may have little interest in the other people's thoughts or feelings. Unless their Feeling side is developed, they may have problems giving other people the level of intimacy that is needed. Unless their Sensing side is developed, they may have a tendency to ignore details which are necessary for implementing their ideas."
INTJ,"The XXXX's interest in dealing with the world is to make decisions, express judgments, and put everything that they encounter into an understandable and rational system. Consequently, they are quick to express judgments. Often they have very evolved intuitions, and are convinced that they are right about things. Unless they complement their intuitive understanding with a well-developed ability to express their insights, they may find themselves frequently misunderstood. In these cases, They tend to blame misunderstandings on the limitations of the other party, rather than on their own difficulty in expressing themselves. This tendency may cause the XXXX to dismiss others input too quickly, and to become generally arrogant and elitist."
INTJ,"They are ambitious, self-confident, deliberate, long-range thinkers. Many They end up in engineering or scientific pursuits, although some find enough challenge within the business world in areas which involve organizing and strategic planning. They dislike messiness and inefficiency, and anything that is muddled or unclear. They value clarity and efficiency, and will put enormous amounts of energy and time into consolidating their insights into structured patterns."
INTJ,"Other people may have a difficult time understanding an XXXX. They may see them as aloof and reserved. Indeed, the XXXX is not overly demonstrative of their affections, and is likely to not give as much praise or positive support as others may need or desire. That doesn't mean that he or she doesn't truly have affection or regard for others, they simply do not typically feel the need to express it. Others may falsely perceive the XXXX as being rigid and set in their ways. Nothing could be further from the truth, because the XXXX is committed to always finding the objective best strategy to implement their ideas. The XXXX is usually quite open to hearing an alternative way of doing something."
INTJ,"When under a great deal of stress, the XXXX may become obsessed with mindless repetitive, Sensate activities, such as over-drinking. They may also tend to become absorbed with minutia and details that they would not normally consider important to their overall goal."
INTJ,"They need to remember to express themselves sufficiently, so as to avoid difficulties with people misunderstandings. In the absence of properly developing their communication abilities, they may become abrupt and short with people, and isolationists."
INTJ,"They have a tremendous amount of ability to accomplish great things. They have insight into the Big Picture, and are driven to synthesize their concepts into solid plans of action. Their reasoning skills gives them the means to accomplish that. They are most always highly competent people, and will not have a problem meeting their career or education goals. They have the capability to make great strides in these arenas. On a personal level, the XXXX who practices tolerances and puts effort into effectively communicating their insights to others has everything in his or her power to lead a rich and rewarding life. . Able to absorb complex theoretical material. Driven to create order and structure from theoretical abstractions. Supreme strategists. Future-oriented. See the global, 'big picture'. Strong insights and intuitions. Value their own opinions over others. Love difficult theoretical challenges. Bored when dealing with mundane routine. Value knowledge and efficiency. Have no patience with inefficiency and confusion. Have very high standards for performance, that they apply to themselves most strongly. Reserved and detached from others. Calm, collected and analytical. Logical and rational. Original and independent. Natural leaders, but will follow those they can fully support. Creative, ingenious, innovative, and resourceful. Work best alone, and prefer to work alone "
INTJ,"More so than any other personality type, They are brilliant when it comes to grasping complex theories and applying them to problems to come up with long-term strategies. Since this type of 'strategizing' is the central focus and drive of the XXXX personality type, there is a happy match between desire and ability in this type. Accordingly, the XXXX is happiest and most effective in careers that allow this type of processing, and that promote an environment in which the XXXX is given a lot of autonomy over their daily lives. . Scientist. Engineer. Professor. Teacher. Medical Doctor. Dentist. Corporate Strategist. Organization Builder. Business Administrator. Business Manager. Military Leader. Attorney. Judge. Computer Programmer"
INTJ,"They believe in constant growth in relationships, and strive for independence for themselves and their mates. They are constantly embarking on 'fix-up' projects to improve the overall quality of their lives and relationships. They take their commitments seriously, but are open to redefining their vows, if they see something which may prove to be an improvement over the existing understanding. They are not likely to be 'touchy-feely' and overly affirming with their mates or children, and may at times be somewhat insensitive to their emotional needs. However, They are in general extremely capable and intelligent individuals who strive to always be their best, and be moving in a positive direction. If they apply these basic goals to their personal relationships, they are likely to enjoy happy and healthy interaction with their families and friends. . Not threatened by conflict or criticism. Usually self-confident. Take their relationships and commitments seriously. Generally extremely intelligent and capable. Able to leave a relationship which should be ended, although they may dwell on it in their minds for awhile afterwards. Interested in 'optimizing' their relationships. Good listeners . Not naturally in tune with others feelings; may be insensitive at times. May tend to respond to conflict with logic and reason, rather than the desired emotional support. Not naturally good at expressing feelings and affections. Tendency to believe that they're always right. Tendency to be unwilling or unable to accept blame. Their constant quest to improve everything may be taxing on relationships. Tend to hold back part of themselves "
INTJ,"They live much of their lives inside their own heads. They constantly scan their environment for new ideas and theories which they can turn into plans and structures. Sometimes, what they see and understand intuitively within themselves is more pure and 'perfect' than the reality of a close personal relationship. They may have a problem reconciling their reality with their fantasy."
INTJ,"They are not naturally in tune with their own feelings, or with what other people are feeling. They also have a tendency to believe that they are always right. While their self-confidence and esteem is attractive, their lack of sensitivity to others can be a problem if it causes them to inadvertantly hurt their partner's feelings. If this is a problem for an XXXX, they should remember to sometimes let their mate be the one who is right, and to try to be aware of the emotional effect that your words have upon them. In conflict situations, They need to remember to be supportive to their mate's emotional needs, rather than treating the conflict as if it is an interesting idea to analyze."
INTJ,"Sexually, the XXXX enjoys thinking about intimacy, and about ways to perfect it. In positive relationships, their creativity and intensity shine through in this arena. In more negative relationships, they might enjoy thinking about sex more than actually doing it. They're likely to approach intimacy from a theoretical, creative perspective, rather than as an opportunity to express love and affection. Although, the XXXX who has learned the importance of these kinds of expressions to the health of their relationship is likely to be more verbally affectionate."
INTJ,"They are able to leave relationships when they're over, and get on with their lives. They believe that this is the right thing to do. They may have more difficulty accomplishing the task than they like to exhibit to other people."
INTJ,"They are highly intense, intelligent people who bring a lot of depth and insight into most major areas of their life. In terms of relationships, their greatest potential pitfall is the tendency to think about things rather than doing them, and their difficulty reconciling reality with their inner visions. They are likely to be in positive, healthy relationships, because they're likely to leave relationships which aren't working for them (unless other circumstances prohibit that)."
INTJ,"As parents, XXXX's main goal is to raise their children to be intelligent, autonomous and independent. They want their kids to think for themselves and make their own decisions, and so are likely to give them room to grow, and to challenge their decisions and thoughts at key points in their lives."
INTJ,"The XXXX is not naturally likely to be an overly supportive or loving parental figure. Since their own need for expressions of love and affirmation is relatively low, they may have difficulty seeing that need in their children who have Feeling preferences. If they do see this sensitivity, they may not recognize or value the importance of feeding it. In such situations, there will be a distance between the XXXX and the child. This is a problem area for the XXXX, who should consciously remember to be aware of others' emotional needs."
INTJ,"They are usually difficult to get to know well, and difficult to get close to. Those who are close to the XXXX will highly value them for their ideas and knowledge. Although They are generally very serious-minded people, they also have been known to enjoy letting loose and having fun, if others pull them into it. They also can be really good at telling jokes, and exhibiting a sarcastic wit with a poker face."
INTJ,"The XXXX is not likely to choose to spend time with people who they feel don't have anything to offer the XXXX. They especially like to spend time with other Intuitive Thinkers, and also usually enjoy the company of Intuitive Feelers. These personality types love to theorize and speculate about ideas, and so can usually relate well to the XXXX, who loves to analyze ideas."
INTJ,"Many They believe that they are always right. In some They, this belief is quite obvious, while in others it is more subtle. Some people may have a difficult time accepting what they see as a 'superior attitude' or 'snobbery'. Not to imply that They are snobbish, just that some people with strong Feeling preferences may perceive them that way. And some individuals simply have no interest in the theoretical pursuits which the XXXX enjoys."
INTJ,"People with the XXXX personality type are serious, analytical and perfectionistic. They look at a problem or idea from multiple perspectives and systematically analyze it with objective logic, discarding things that turn out to be problematic, and evolving their own understanding of something when new information turns out to be useful. There is no other personality type who does this as naturally as the XXXX. They are natural scientists and mathematicians. Once given an idea, they are driven to understand it as thoroughly as possible. They usually have very high standards for their own understanding and accomplishments, and generally will only value and consider other individuals who have shown that they meet or surpass the XXXX's own understanding on a given issue. They value clarity and conciseness, and have little esteem for behaviors and attitudes that are purely social. Social 'niceties' often seem unnecessary and perhaps even ungenuine to the XXXX, who is always seeking to improve their substantive understanding. XXXX's highly value social interaction that is centered around the meaningful exchange of ideas, but they usually dismiss the importance of being friendly or likeable in other social contexts, and they are likely to be uncomfortable with interactions that are primarily emotional, rather than logical. They value structure, order, knowledge, competence, and logic. Above all, they value their own ideas and intuitions about the world. An XXXX's feeling of success depends primarily upon their own level of understanding and accomplishment, but also depends upon the level of structure in their life, and their ability to respect the intelligence and competence of those who share their life."
INTJ,"The XXXX's mind is naturally geared towards systematically analyzing information from many contextual perspectives, and rejecting or retaining information as they become aware of its usefulness or validity. They probably do very well in school, and in any pursuit that requires serious analytical thinking. They're extremely insightful, and see things that are not obvious to others. This ability to see patterns and meanings in the world can help the XXXX in many different ways. When given a goal or context, an XXXX is able to generate all kinds of possibilities. They're able to see the problem from many different angles, and come up with a solution that fits the needs of the current situation. They don't take criticism personally, and are open to changing their opinions when they're shown a better idea or better way of doing something. An XXXX has a 'stick to it' attitude. They're not afraid of hard work, and will put forth a great deal of effort towards something that they are interested in. This persistence will help the XXXX to achieve any identified goal. Usually intelligent and able to concentrate and focus, the XXXX can usually grasp difficult ideas and concepts."
INTJ,"They can discriminate well amongst their intuitions and build ingenious systems to meet identified goals, or determine a successful plan of action to meet an identified need. In such a way, they may be brilliant scientists, doctors, mathematicians, or corporate strategists. Their deep understanding, logical abilities, and persistence may enable them to make discoveries or uncover new ways of looking at something. In such a way, they may perform a great service to society. For example, an XXXX is the likely personality type to discover the cure for cancer. The XXXX with well-developed judgment will be able to grasp and process concepts that are beyond what their natural intelligence appears to be able to handle. If they have achieved a good amount of life wisdom, an XXXX can become a powerful political force."
INTJ,"They are rare and intelligent people with many special gifts. This should be kept in mind as you read some of the more negative material about XXXX weaknesses. Remember that these weaknesses are natural. We offer this information to enact positive change, rather than as blatant criticism. We want you to grow into your full potential, and be the happiest and most successful person that you can become."
INTJ,"May be unaware (and sometimes uncaring) of how they come across to others May quickly dismiss input from others without really considering it May apply their judgment more often towards others, rather than towards themselves With their ability to see an issue from many sides, they may always find others at fault for problems in their own lives May look at external ideas and people with the primary purpose of finding fault May take pride in their ability to be critical and find fault in people and things May have unrealistic and/or unreasonable expectations of others May be intolerant of weaknesses in others May believe that they're always right May be cuttingly derisive and sarcastic towards others May have an intense and quick temper May hold grudges, and have difficulty forgiving people May be wishy-washy and unsure how to act in situations that require May have difficulty communicating their thoughts and feelings to others May see so many tangents everywhere that they can't stay focused on the bottom line or the big picture"
INTJ,"Most of the problems described above are a result of Xx overtaking the XXXX's personality to the point that all of the other functions become slaves to Xx. A healthy personality needs to have a good balance between its dominant and auxiliary functions. For an XXXX, the dominant Xx needs to be well-supported by the auxiliary Xx function. If Xx exists only to support the desires of Xx, then neither function is being used to its potential."
INTJ,"Xx is a personality function that constantly gathers information, and sees everything from many different perspectives. As the dominant player in a personality, it has the effect of constantly bombarding the psyche with new information to consider. Xx is sort of like a framework for understanding that exists in the mind. As something is perceived, it is melded into the existing intuitive framework. If an entirely new piece of information is perceived by the Introverted iNtuitive, that person must redefine their entire framework of reference. So, Introverted iNtuitives are constantly taking in information about the world that needs to be processed in a relatively lengthy manner in order to be understood. That presents quite a challenge to the XXXX. It's not unusual for an XXXX to feel overwhelmed with all of the things that he or she needs to consider in order to fully understand an idea or situation."
INTJ,"When Xx dominates the XXXX such that the other functions cannot serve their own purposes, we find the XXXX cutting off information that it needs to consider. If the psyche is presented with information that looks anything like something that Xx has processed in the past, it uses Xx to quickly reject that information. The psyche uses Xx to reject the ideas, rather than analyzing the information within its intuitive framework, and therefore reduces the likelihood that the framework will have to be reshaped and redefined."
INTJ,"Using Xx in this manner serves the XXXX's psyche in two ways: 1) it saves it the energy that would have to be expended to truly consider new information, and 2) it protects the XXXX's sacred inner world. In either case, it is not ideal. It causes the XXXX to not consider information that may be useful or criticial in developing a real understanding of an issue. It also probably causes the XXXX to come off as too strongly opinionated or snobbish to others."
INTJ,"The better use of Xx for an XXXX would be to use it to assess the XXXX's rich insights and weigh them against the external world. When the XXXX personality uses Xx to cut off incoming information, rather than to judge internal intuitions, it is effectively cheating itself. It's like getting the answers to a test without having to really understand the questions. It's easier to get the answer right away, rather than to have to figure everything out. For the XXXX, who has a tremendous amount of information and 'studying' that needs to be done, it's very tempting to take shortcuts. Most They will do this to some extent. The real problems occur when an XXXX personality has become so imbalanced that its owner is extremely self-important and rarely consider anyone else's opinions or ideas."
INTJ,"To grow as an individual, the XXXX needs to focus on applying their judgment to things only after they have gone through their intuition. In other words, the XXXX needs to consciously try not to use their judgment to dismiss ideas prematurely. Rather, they should use their judgment against their own ideas. One cannot effectively judge something that they don't understand. The XXXX needs to take things entirely into their intuition in order to understand them. It may be neccesary to give your intuition enough time to work through the new information so that it can rebuild its global framework of understanding. They need to focus on using their judgment not to dismiss ideas, but rather to support their intuitive framework."
INTJ,"An XXXX who is concerned with personal growth will pay close attention to the subject of their judgments, and their motivation for making judgments. Are they judging something external to themself, or are they judging something that they have sifted through their intuition? Is the motivation for judging something to be able to understand its usefulness in the world, or to dismiss it? Too often, an XXXX will judge something without properly understanding it, and with the intention of dismissing it. Seek first to understand, then to judge."
INTJ,"Some They have difficulty fitting into our society. Their problems are generally associated with not knowing (or caring) how they come across to others, with having unreasonable expectations for others' behaviors, and with not putting forth effort to meet others' emotional needs. These issues stem primarily from the common XXXX habit of using Xx to find fault externally, rather than internally, and therefore diminish the importance of the external world, and increase the importance of the XXXX's own internal world. They who recognize that their knowledge and understanding (and therefore general happiness and feeling of success) can be enriched by the synergy of other people's knowledge and understanding will find that they can be committed to their rich internal worlds and still have satisfying relationships with others. In order to accomplish this, the XXXX needs to recognize the importance of extraversion, and develop their highest extraverted function, Xx."
INTJ,"An XXXX who uses Xx to find fault externally rather than internally may become so strongly opinionated that they form rigid and unreasonable expectations for others. Their hyper-vigilant judgments about the rationality and competence of others may be a very effective way of keeping themselves at an emotional distance from others. This will preserve the sanctity of the XXXX's inner world of ideas, but will reduce a lot of valuable input, arrest the development of their social character, and stagnate the development of the XXXX's rich structural framework of understanding. In extreme cases, the XXXX may find himself or herself quite along and lonely."
INTJ,"More commonly, an XXXX's interpersonal problems will occur when they express their displeasure to those close to them in very biting and hurtful terms. Everyone needs emotional distance at one time or another, and the XXXX wants more than most types. Perhaps this is why They are famous for their biting sarcasm. An XXXX's internal world is extremely important to them. They may be protecting their internal world by using sarcasm to keep others at an emotional distance, or they may be sarcastic with others because they believe that they have the more evolved and logical understanding of the issue at hand, and seek to cut off the spurious input that they're receiving. This is an important distinction to recognize. An XXXX who is seeking an emotional respite can find ways to be alone that don't require injuring feelings and damaging relationships. When distance is required, the XXXX should just 'leave'. If an explanation is necessary, an XXXX should use their Xx to explain their need rationally and objectively, rather than using Xx to insult the other person, and therefore prod them into leaving."
ENTP,"As an XXXX, your primary mode of living is focused externally, where you take things in primarily via your intuition. Your secondary mode is internal, where you deal with things rationally and logically."
ENTP,"With Xx dominating their personality, the XXXX's primary interest in life is understanding the world that they live in. They are constantly absorbing ideas and images about the situations they are presented in their lives. Using their intuition to process this information, they are usually extremely quick and accurate in their ability to size up a situation. With the exception of their XXXX cousin, the XXXX has a deeper understanding of their environment than any of the other types."
ENTP,"This ability to intuitively understand people and situations puts the XXXX at a distinct advantage in their lives. They generally understand things quickly and with great depth. Accordingly, they are quite flexible and adapt well to a wide range of tasks. They are good at most anything that interests them. As they grow and further develop their intuitive abilities and insights, they become very aware of possibilities, and this makes them quite resourceful when solving problems."
ENTP,"They are idea people. Their perceptive abilities cause them to see possibilities everywhere. They get excited and enthusiastic about their ideas, and are able to spread their enthusiasm to others. In this way, they get the support that they need to fulfill their visions."
ENTP,"They are less interested in developing plans of actions or making decisions than they are in generating possibilities and ideas. Following through on the implementation of an idea is usually a chore to the XXXX. For some They, this results in the habit of never finishing what they start. The XXXX who has not developed their Thinking process will have problems with jumping enthusiastically from idea to idea, without following through on their plans. The XXXX needs to take care to think through their ideas fully in order to take advantage of them."
ENTP,"The XXXX's auxiliary process of Xx drives their decision making process. Although the XXXX is more interested in absorbing information than in making decisions, they are quite rational and logical in reaching conclusions. When they apply Thinking to their Intuitive perceptions, the outcome can be very powerful indeed. A well-developed XXXX is extremely visionary, inventive, and enterprising."
ENTP,"They are fluent conversationalists, mentally quick, and enjoy verbal sparring with others. They love to debate issues, and may even switch sides sometimes just for the love of the debate. When they express their underlying principles, however, they may feel awkward and speak abruptly and intensely."
ENTP,"The XXXX personality type is sometimes referred to the 'Lawyer' type. The XXXX 'lawyer' quickly and accurately understands a situation, and objectively and logically acts upon the situation. Their Thinking side makes their actions and decisions based on an objective list of rules or laws. If the XXXX was defending someone who had actually committed a crime, they are likely to take advantage of quirks in the law that will get their client off the hook. If they were to actually win the case, they would see their actions as completely fair and proper to the situation, because their actions were lawful. The guilt or innocence of their client would not be as relevant. If this type of reasoning goes uncompletely unchecked by the XXXX, it could result in a character that is perceived by others as unethical or even dishonest. The XXXX, who does not naturally consider the more personal or human element in decision making, should take care to notice the subjective, personal side of situations. This is a potential problem are for They. Although their logical abilities lend strength and purpose to the XXXX, they may also isolate them from their feelings and from other people."
ENTP,"The least developed area for the XXXX is the Sensing-Feeling arena. If the Sensing areas are neglected, the XXXX may tend to not take care of details in their life. If the Feeling part of themself is neglected, the XXXX may not value other people's input enough, or may become overly harsh and aggressive."
ENTP,"Under stress, the XXXX may lose their ability to generate possibilities, and become obsessed with minor details. These details may seem to be extremely important to the XXXX, but in reality are usually not important to the big picture."
ENTP,"In general, They are upbeat visionaries. They highly value knowledge, and spend much of their lives seeking a higher understanding. They live in the world of possibilities, and become excited about concepts, challenges and difficulties. When presented with a problem, they're good at improvising and quickly come up with a creative solution. Creative, clever, curious, and theoretical, They have a broad range of possibilities in their lives. . Interested in people. Project-oriented. Enjoy generating ideas and theories. Creative and ingenius. Bright and capable. Flexible and Diverse. Excellent communication skills. Enjoy debating issues with other people. Excellent people skills. Natural leaders, but do not like to control people. Resist being controlled by others. Lively and energetic; able to motivate others. Highly value knowledge and competence. Logical, rational thinkers. Able to grasp difficult concepts and theories. Enjoy solving difficult problems. Dislike confining schedules and environments. Dislike routine, detailed tasks "
ENTP,"They are fortunate to have a wide range of capabilities. They are generally good at anything that has captured their interest. They are likely to be successful in many different careers. Since they have a lot of options open to them, They will do well to choose professions that allow them a lot of personal freedom where they can use their creativity to generate new ideas and solve problems. They will not be completely happy in positions that are regimented or confining.. Attorney. Psychologist. Entrepreneur. Photographer. Consultant. Engineer. Scientist. Actor. Sales Rep. Marketing Rep. Computer Programmer. Systems Analyst"
ENTP,"Typically good-natured, upbeat and laid-back, They can be delightful people to be around. They get a lot of enjoyment and satisfaction from interacting with others, and especially enjoy discussing and debating theories and concepts which interest them. They may be prone to initiate arguments because they so enjoy the debate. They are generally fun-loving and gregarious, and can be quite charming. They have a problem with sometimes neglecting their close relationships when they become involved in the pursuit of a new idea or plan. . Enthusiastic, upbeat, and popular. Can be very charming. Excellent communication skills. Extremely interested in self-improvement and growth in their relationships. Laid-back and flexible, usually easy to get along with. Big idea-people, always working on a grand scheme or idea. Usually good at making money, although not so good at managing it. Take their commitments and relationships very seriously. Able to move on with their lives after leaving a relationship . Always excited by anything new, they may change partners frequently. Tendency to not follow through on their plans and ideas. Their love of debate may cause them to provoke arguments. Big risk-takers and big spenders, not usually good at managing money. Although they take their commitments seriously, they tend to abandon their relationships which no longer offer opportunity for growth "
ENTP,"XXXX's goals for their intimate relationships are similar to their other personal goals: improvement and growth. They constantly ask themselves questions such as: How can the relationship be improved? Where is the relationship headed? Am I growing in the relationship? They are likely to enthusiastically embrace new ideas and projects for themselves and their mates which they feel will propel them along their goal for growth and knowledge discovery. The XXXX's general enthusiasiam and good intentions are usually quite positive and healthful in a relationship."
ENTP,"problem area for XXXX's is their tendency to not follow through on their schemes. This can be frustrating to their mates. It may also create a 'boy who called wolf' syndrome in their relationships, with their partner never believing that the XXXX will actually do what they say they'll do."
ENTP,"Another potential problem area is the XXXX's general tendency towards 'wildness' and willingness to take risks. They may lead the family into uncomfortable financial situations, which can be quite stressful on intimate relationships."
ENTP,"Sexually, the XXXX is enthusiastic and interested in positive, constant growth for both partners. They're likely to be very attentive, involved, and questioning. They enjoy spontaneity rather than fixed schedules, and fully embrace new ideas and adventures. They're likely to approach intimacy as more of a physical act which conveys affection, rather than as an opportunity to explicitly express affection."
ENTP,"In general, XXXX's childlike enthusiasm and genuine interest in the health and direction of the relationship makes them willing and able to promote healthy, growing relationships with their significant others. They need to watch out for their tendency to be unaware of what others are feeling, and to inadvertantly neglect their relationships when faced with exciting possibilities that are external to their personal life."
ENTP,"With their fun and upbeat natures, there's a little bit of kid inside all They. They approach parenthood with a fun-loving attitude which has a serious underlying goal: to make everything a learning exercise (for themselves as well as for their children) which promotes the child's growth into an independent, logical thinker."
ENTP,"The XXXX is likely to be somewhat inconsistent about spending quality time with their children. One minute they will exhibit a lot of interest and enthusiasm towards being around their kids, and will display a great deal of affection for them. However, as soon as they get caught-up in one of their grand schemes for improving a system somewhere, they're likely to inadvertantly neglect their kids."
ENTP,"They can get along with almost all other types of people. They are intuitive about what makes others tick, although they generally lack the ability to sympathize or relate to others who do not see things the same way as the XXXX. They are flexible and easy-going, and genuinely enjoy interacting with others."
ENTP,"Although the XXXX is able to get along with a wide variety of people, they are likely to choose to surround themselves with people who are intelligent, capable, and idea-oriented. They love nothing better than engaging in a good debate with someone who can hold their end of the conversation. This will stimulate and energize the XXXX, who is highly competitive and loves to discuss theories."
ENTP,"Sometimes the XXXX falls into the habit of practicing 'one-upmanship'. If this goes unchecked, it may cause a problem with friendships and close interpersonal relationships."
ENTP,"XXXX personalities are motivated by possibilities. They love the outside chances; the new or unusual combinations lurking within the ordinary everyday world of things and ideas. For them, something is always on the up, something is always tantalizing their desire to re-orchestrate life into new patterns and shapes; new ways of fulfilling what can be as strong as a never ending desire to beat the odds and win at every game in town, or as mild as a quirky personal need for constant variety and change. With their thinking tied to the myriad possibilities they see in the world, they act swiftly and decisively upon those angles, choices and combinations scarcely noticed by other types, but through which they can build whole new frameworks or completely redefine an existing external situation in such a way that it appears new, revitalized and once again full of promise. Sameness, stasis, conservatism - even daily routine - can be loathsome to fervent They, whose drive is always to be into something new, different and full of fresh possibilities, and who, given the opportunity, will always be the first to show others a new path to success in a venture, or to find a way of doing something that no-one has done before."
ENTP,"XXXX people measure their success by their 'aha' moments, by the sense of satisfaction which comes as they spread their newly written maps before them and contemplate the new adventure, design, investigation or conquest which has now become their road ahead. What has gone before, previous achievements, ways of living - even people met along the way - are often now forgotten or considered passe, mere steps along a path which has now brought a new frontier to be exploited for its gifts. Whether it is the search for knowledge, money, power, fame or pleasure, the XXXX will be found at the frontline, gazing into the distance and discovering new avenues toward, bigger, better or more satisfying outcomes."
ENTP,"They are the great problem solvers, discoverers and re-inventors of the world. Their insights into the world around them, their ability to see new ways of putting things together and making them work can bring them great success in virtually any industry or human pursuit that interests them. For this reason the XXXX is happiest in situations where they can use their intuitive powers freely and have the space in which to think upon the aspects and angles which come to them. Without fulfilling work and the freedom to use their mind most productively, They can quickly tire of a limiting situation. For this reason an open road toward success is an extremely important factor in the They life. Some, given a little opportunity, will clear one for themselves, but of all the types, it is the XXXX who has most need to be aware of the life and career situations they might commit to without sufficient thought for the future."
ENTP,"The ability to hold many points of view in mind and see their differing merits. Seeing ways to do things others have not thought of. Able to give quick and diverse answers to any question of interest. Seeing the other side of a situation and making it known. Being able to juggle many differing jobs or processes at the one time. Easily capable of holding your own in any argument or discussion. The ability to quickly find the best or most useful side of others. Seeing the many connections between events and things which are not immediately obvious to others."
ENTP,"The ability to solve puzzles and problems that have no obvious way to resolution. The ability to define schematically a new structure or design and know it will work. Knowing and giving to others the very thing they need when they are not sure themselves. A talent for innovative creation in writing, music or the visual arts. The gift of knowing which new ideas or changes will enhance rather than detract from their relationships with others"
ENTP,"The inability to maintain a comfortable situation or relationship once its possibilities have been realized or exhausted. A tendency to consider careful or meticulous thinkers as unworthy plodders or time wasters. Blindness to the needs and feelings of others not directly involved in the XXXX's current area of interest. A lack of sensitivity to the feelings and ways of those who might need reassurance, security or commitment. The inability to deal carefully and calmly with the finer details of a situation or work in progress. Tendency to become overly annoyed by minor setbacks or small things that have to be set right before the goal can be realized. A tendency to be arrogant or boastful, or to demean those who cannot see the same answers. Can often find themselves in bad situations by too quickly taking a big step forward or by being 'too smart for their own good'."
ENTP,"Nearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be attributed in various degrees to the common XXXX problem of being so fascinated with their Extroverted Intuitions that they fail to develop a careful thinking process sufficient to balance it. Leaps of perception, new ideas and strange but fascinating juxtapositions are wonderful for the potential freshness and possible success they might bring. But if not carefully appraised and chosen wisely they can also take us far from the right path in life, take us from our friends, spoil our relationships and even bring personal or financial disaster. Without a well developed thinking function, the XXXX is always in danger of leaping over social, financial and personal constraints for the sake of following a new vision. This might be as simple as arousing the wrath of ones partner by suddenly deciding to by an expensive gadget or change something around the house without being concerned for their input or feelings, or as complex as allowing an ill considered entrepreneurial idea lead them into financial and social disaster, simply because the one sided vision of Extroverted Intuition does not recognize or count the amount of small but important details which need to be right before such ideas can be realized."
ENTP,"Without a solid thinking function, the XXXX can easily discount or fail to notice the essential ethics of social and interpersonal relationship, often considering themselves 'above' or untouched by such limiting values and often discounting the possibility that their actions might be or hurtful or seen as unethical by others. It is not that the one sided XXXX is deliberately hurtful, but simply ignorant of the effects which can flow from their often compulsive need for change or need to show how clever or individual they are. In the XXXX, the lack of a well developed Feeling Function means that they must learn to understand feeling in both themselves and others and come to terms with its affects. This understanding can only come from thinking carefully about the ways feeling affects not only themselves, but others, and the importance others place on this function. The XXXX has a feeling function more or less global in character and one which does not judge fine differences. This inability to discriminate feelings can allow the XXXX to say and do much that leaves others in the cold, so an effort to think about the feeling process can be essential. Without the understanding this brings, the XXXX can separate themselves from the ground of their life, from the constancy of their friends and family and, without even realizing it, they can easily find themselves in untenable positions where, without support, they wonder why they are suddenly alone and lost."
ENTP,"Another significant problem arises where the XXXX has grown within or is locked by circumstances to an environment which limits their freedom or their ability to utilize their specific abilities. This forces the XXXX to narrow down their intuitive process to the point where it retains at least some freedom to operate within their life. Under such conditions however, the intuition is free only to range over a small and limited field of vision, a field which usually consists only of the very things the XXXX is normally unconcerned about: the small details of life and its familiar objects. Without the ability to take stock and apply careful thought to the ways they might expand their horizons, the XXXX in such situations can become morose, niggardly and obsessed with the most minor or intangible details - to the point where such minutiae fill their life and each day becomes a frustrating process of eliminating again and again the little problems which ever seem to stand in the way of the 'big picture' - a picture which, as those around them know only too well, will never be realized."
ENTP,"To grow as an individual, the XXXX needs to focus on carefully analyzing the information they receive via their Xx. They need to allow themselves sufficient time and space to relax with the ideas and possibilities they can see. It is all too easy for the XXXX to assume that what they see is what they need. Careful thinking can allow the XXXX to 'suss out' the best possible ways to proceed out of all the possibilities that come to them. At the same time, even if they are not able to share them, They need at least to understand the joys and satisfactions that others derive within those situations the XXXX would not normally choose in life. Awareness of the ways and needs of others can be the key to understanding the most life affirming way ahead for the XXXX, for there is always a danger that they might choose paths without regard to the feelings and needs of others close to them. The XXXX learns from analyzing his experience, so the best way for the XXXX to grow as a person is to develop his thinking capacity. Thus, that while the desire to run out and do something 'new' is an XXXX pattern of need, this need must be integrated into a whole way of life in which the rest of our human needs and those of others who rely upon our presence are also satisfied. Your task, as a person interested in personal growth, is to understand yourself in a truly objective fashion, and how you can best give to the world, rather than just exploit the possibilities it bring to you."
ENTP,"The XXXX should always pay close attention to why they are acting upon new information. Are they acting out of a carefully considered motive to realize something truly worthwhile for themselves and others? Are they really seeking to improve life, or concerned with just making the next play, proving the point, showing others the moves or climbing the mountain just because it is there to climb, regardless of the consequences?"
ENTP,"The problems They might have fitting into the world are not usually directly related to friends or relationships. Rather, the XXXX has trouble maintaining a stable and consistent lifestyle. While this can affect love relationships, the XXXX usually has such an endearing and capable 'way' about them that others tend to follow their lead, even in the most trying of situations. The problems the XXXX generates in life are those associated with their constant need for individuality, excellence and new experiences which test their talents. While this can place great demand upon relationships, tensions are usually only apparent where the XXXX has made a love match with a person whose security needs are greater than their ability to allow their XXXX partner the freedom they need. The self aware XXXX must therefore not only be careful in considering their career choices, but also in choosing a life situation with a partner. Of all the types, the XXXX is most uncomfortable with compromise and ought not to place themselves in situations which demand it. Most importantly the XXXX must become aware, through careful analysis of experience, just what kind of changes for the good or bad have been the direct result of their need for constant refreshment of life. Only through this awareness will the XXXX be able to focus on those perceptions which promise a better and more fruitful life."
INTP,"As an XXXX, your primary mode of living is focused internally, where you deal with things rationally and logically. Your secondary mode is external, where you take things in primarily via your intuition."
INTP,"They live in the world of theoretical possibilities. They see everything in terms of how it could be improved, or what it could be turned into. They live primarily inside their own minds, having the ability to analyze difficult problems, identify patterns, and come up with logical explanations. They seek clarity in everything, and are therefore driven to build knowledge. They are the 'absent-minded professors', who highly value intelligence and the ability to apply logic to theories to find solutions. They typically are so strongly driven to turn problems into logical explanations, that they live much of their lives within their own heads, and may not place as much importance or value on the external world. Their natural drive to turn theories into concrete understanding may turn into a feeling of personal responsibility to solve theoretical problems, and help society move towards a higher understanding."
INTP,"They value knowledge above all else. Their minds are constantly working to generate new theories, or to prove or disprove existing theories. They approach problems and theories with enthusiasm and skepticism, ignoring existing rules and opinions and defining their own approach to the resolution. They seek patterns and logical explanations for anything that interests them. They're usually extremely bright, and able to be objectively critical in their analysis. They love new ideas, and become very excited over abstractions and theories. They love to discuss these concepts with others. They may seem 'dreamy' and distant to others, because they spend a lot of time inside their minds musing over theories. They hate to work on routine things - they would much prefer to build complex theoretical solutions, and leave the implementation of the system to others. They are intensely interested in theory, and will put forth tremendous amounts of time and energy into finding a solution to a problem with has piqued their interest."
INTP,"They do not like to lead or control people. They're very tolerant and flexible in most situations, unless one of their firmly held beliefs has been violated or challenged, in which case they may take a very rigid stance. The XXXX is likely to be very shy when it comes to meeting new people. On the other hand, the XXXX is very self-confident and gregarious around people they know well, or when discussing theories which they fully understand."
INTP,"The XXXX has no understanding or value for decisions made on the basis of personal subjectivity or feelings. They strive constantly to achieve logical conclusions to problems, and don't understand the importance or relevance of applying subjective emotional considerations to decisions. For this reason, They are usually not in-tune with how people are feeling, and are not naturally well-equiped to meet the emotional needs of others."
INTP,"The XXXX may have a problem with self-aggrandizement and social rebellion, which will interfere with their creative potential. Since their Feeling side is their least developed trait, the XXXX may have difficulty giving the warmth and support that is sometimes necessary in intimate relationships. If the XXXX doesn't realize the value of attending to other people's feelings, he or she may become overly critical and sarcastic with others. If the XXXX is not able to find a place for themself which supports the use of their strongest abilities, they may become generally negative and cynical. If the XXXX has not developed their Sensing side sufficiently, they may become unaware of their environment, and exhibit weakness in performing maintenance-type tasks, such as bill-paying and dressing appropriately."
INTP,"For the XXXX, it is extremely important that ideas and facts are expressed correctly and succinctly. They are likely to express themselves in what they believe to be absolute truths. Sometimes, their well thought-out understanding of an idea is not easily understandable by others, but the XXXX is not naturally likely to tailor the truth so as to explain it in an understandable way to others. The XXXX may be prone to abandoning a project once they have figured it out, moving on to the next thing. It's important that the XXXX place importance on expressing their developed theories in understandable ways. In the end, an amazing discovery means nothing if you are the only person who understands it."
INTP,"The XXXX is usually very independent, unconventional, and original. They are not likely to place much value on traditional goals such as popularity and security. They usually have complex characters, and may tend to be restless and temperamental. They are strongly ingenious, and have unconventional thought patterns which allows them to analyze ideas in new ways. Consequently, a lot of scientific breakthroughs in the world have been made by the XXXX."
INTP,"The XXXX is at his best when he can work on his theories independently. When given an environment which supports his creative genius and possible eccentricity, the XXXX can accomplish truly remarkable things. These are the pioneers of new thoughts in our society. . Love theory and abstract ideas. Truth Seekers - they want to understand things by analyzing underlying principles and structures. Value knowledge and competence above all else. Have very high standards for performance, that they apply to themselves. Independent and original, possibly eccentric. Work best alone, and value autonomy. Have no desire to lead or follow. Dislike mundane detail. Not particularly interested in the practical application of their work. Creative and insightful. Future-oriented. Usually brilliant and ingenius. Trust their own insights and opinions above others. Live primarily inside their own minds, and may appear to be detached and uninvolved with other people "
INTP,"They have a special gift with generating and analyzing theories and possibilities to prove or disprove them. They have a great deal of insight and are creative thinkers; this allows them to quickly grasp complex abstract thoughts. They also have exceptional logical and rational reasoning skills, which allows them to thoroughly analyze theories to discover the Truth about them. Since the XXXX is driven to seek clarity in the world, we have a happy match of desire and ability in this personality type. They will be happiest in careers that allow them a great deal of autonomy in which they can work primarily alone on developing and analyzing complex theories and abstractions, with the goal of their work being the discovery of a truth, rather than the discovery of a practical application. . Scientist. Physicist. Chemist. Photographer. Strategic Planner. Mathematician. University Professor. Computer Programmer. Systems Analyst. Technical Writer. Engineer. Attorney. Judge. Forensic Research. Park Ranger. Mechanic"
INTP,"They live rich worlds inside their minds, which are full of imagination and excitement. Consequently, they sometimes find the external world pales in comparison. This may result in a lack of motivation to form and maintain relationships. They are not likely to have a very large circle of significant relationships in their lives. They're much more likely to have a few very close relationships, which they hold in great esteem and with great affection. Since the XXXX's primary focus and attention is turned inwards, aimed towards seeking clarity from abstract ideas, they are not naturally tuned into others' emotional feelings and needs. They tend to be difficult to get to know well, and hold back parts of themselves until the other person has proven themselves 'worthy' of hearing the XXXX's thoughts. Holding Knowledge and Brain Power above all else in importance, the XXXX will choose to be around people who they consider to be intelligent. Once the XXXX has committed themself to a relationship, they tend to be very faithful and loyal, and form affectionate attachments which are pure and straight-forward. The XXXX has no interest or understanding of game-playing with regards to relationships. However, if something happens which the XXXX considers irreconciliable, they will leave the relationship and not look back. . They feel love and affection for those close to them which is almost childlike in its purity. Generally laid-back and easy-going, willing to defer to their mates. Approach things which interest them very enthusiastically. Richly imaginative and creative. Do not feel personally threatened by conflict or criticism. Usually are not demanding, with simple daily needs . Not naturally in tune with others' feelings; slow to respond to emotional needs. Not naturally good at expressing their own feelings and emotions. Tend to be suspicious and distrusting of others. Not usually good at practical matters, such as money management, unless their work involves these concerns. They have difficulty leaving bad relationships. Tend to 'blow off' conflict situations by ignoring them, or else they 'blow up' in heated anger "
INTP,"They approach their intimate relationships quite seriously - as they approach most things in life. They take their vows and commitments seriously, and are usually faithful and loyal. They are usually pretty easy to live with and be around, because they have simple daily needs and are not overly demanding of their partners in almost any respect. While the XXXX's internal life is highly theoretical and complex, their external life in comparison is usually quite simple. They like to keep the complexities of their external world to a minimum, so that they can focus their brain power on working through their theories internally. This makes them very straight-forward, honest lovers, with a love that is quite pure in its simple, uncomplicated nature."
INTP,"Although they choose to keep things straight-forward in their relationships, this does not mean that the XXXX is lacking in depth of feeling or passion. The XXXX is very creative person, who has vivid imaginations. They can be very excitable and passionate about their love relationships. Sometimes, they have a problem reconciling the exciting visions of their internal worlds with the actuality of their external circumstances."
INTP,"Sexually, the XXXX usually approaches intimacy with enthusiasm and excitement. Some They play down entirely the need for sexual relations in their lives, but most use their rich imaginations and child-like enthusiasm to make the most of the moment. The XXXX will usually be experiencing the moment with vivid intensity inside their own minds, although this may or may not be apparent to their partner."
INTP,"The largest area of potential strife in an XXXX's intimate relationship is their slowness in understanding and meeting their partner's emotional needs. The XXXX may be extremely dedicated to the relationship, and deeply in love with their partner, but may have no understanding of their mate's emotional life, and may not express their own feelings often or well. When the XXXX does express themselves, it's likely to be in their own way at their own time, rather than in response to their partner's needs. If this is an issue which has caused serious problems in a relationship, the XXXX should work on becoming more aware of their partner's feelings, and their partner should work on not requiring explicit positive affirmation to feel loved by the XXXX."
INTP,"They do not like to deal with messy complications, such as interpersonal conflict, and so they may fall into the habit of ignoring conflict when it occurs. If they feel they must face the conflict, they're likely to approach it from an analytical perspective. This may aggravate the conflict situation, if their partner simply wants to feel that they are supported and loved. Most people (and especially those with the Feeling preference) simply want to be encouraged, affirmed and supported when they are upset. The XXXX should practice meeting these needs in conflict situations."
INTP,"They love and respect Knowledge, and want to pass their jewels of thought down to their children. Their greatest goal and satisfaction as a parent is seeing their children grow into independent, rational adults."
INTP,"XXXX parents are likely to encourage their children to grow as individuals, rather than attempt to fit them into a preconceived mold. They will stress autonomy through the children's growth. They're likely to respect their children's opinions and wishes, and allow their children to have a voice and presence in the family."
INTP,"The XXXX parents are likely to be pretty laid-back and flexible with their children, sometimes to the point of being relatively 'hands-off' with regards to the day-to-day issues. They're likely to count on their spouse for providing structure and schedules. Since the XXXX themself does not live in an overly structured or organized manner, they're not likely to expect or create this environment for their children. If their spouse is not someone with the 'J' preference, their children may suffer from a lack of boundaries. This is something the XXXX should pay special attention to. Growing children don't know Right from Wrong, and so benefit from having their parents define these boundaries for them."
INTP,"In spite of their relatively unstructured approach to parenting, They take their role as parent very seriously, and are likely to put forth much effort into doing what they feel will be most effective in helping their children grow into independent, wise adults. They enjoy parenting, and get a lot of fun out of their children. They're also likely to be very proud and loyal parents."
INTP,"They may have a problem meeting the emotional needs of their children. Although they generally are deeply caring and supportive individuals, the XXXX does not always pick up on emotional clues. A troubled child of an unaware XXXX parent may have to result to drastic 'attention-getting' tactics to get their parent to understand their emotional difficulties. If you find yourself in this situation, you may find that expressing some of your own emotions will do wonders for your child, yourself, and your relationship. Although it may not be possible for you to suddenly be 'tuned in' on what your children are feeling, at least you can let them know that you care."
INTP,"Children of XXXX parents generally remember them respectfully and affectionately as loyal, fair, and tolerant parents, who care for them a great deal, although they don't often show it."
INTP,"They are likely to have friends who share their interests and pursuits. Since the XXXX loves theories, ideas, and concepts, they are not likely to have much patience or understanding for people with the Sensing preference, who are not usually comfortable with abstract conceptualizing."
INTP,"People with the XXXX personality type are global thinkers. They see everything as one giant Entity that is connected, and seek knowledge about that Entity. They constantly seek the Truth, and have ultimate respect for the Truth. It is not easy for the XXXX to reach a conclusion about the Truth. Their auxiliary function of Xx allows them to absorb the many complexities in our world, and they are driven to consider each of these complexities before reaching a conclusion. Once they have reached a conclusion, or discovered a Truth, they are *very* particular about the way that Truth is expressed and understood. They want to know that the principles of their understanding have been understood correctly, and demand absolute precision and correctness from others when describing these principles. They also apply these standards to themselves when communicating their knowledge. If they take the time to develop their communication so that it meets their own approval, they can be extremely good educational writers."
INTP,"In addition to their immense respect for metaphysical principles, facts, and Truths, the XXXX highly respects logic and the way that the mind works logically when seeking to master some subject or situation. They get great pleasure from engaging in logical acts that require quick, spatial reasoning, such as mind games, or time-based IQ tests. The XXXX shines in this realm. Xx is an 'action-based' kind of logic. In the case of the XXXX (as opposed to XXXX), the action may or may not occur in a physical place outside of the XXXX's mind, but it is experienced with lightning speed in the current moment, based on current objects, using subjectively understood 'actions' of reason."
INTP,"The XXXX is happiest in situations in which they can use logic regularly in an effort to uncover Truths about the Entity. Their ability to be effective in these efforts, as well as their ability to deal with people and feel comfortable with their place in the world, will be in large part dependent on the development of Xx. Although they have more simple needs from interpersonal relationships than most other types have, it's very important that they keep up their extraverted relationships, rather than going it alone. They who isolate themselves rarely feel happy or successful. The XXXX's feeling of success depends upon their opportunities to exercise their active mind, their opportunities to seek and find Truth, and the condition of their relationships and extraverted life."
INTP,"They have a natural ability to focus and get 'into the zone' when working on a problem. They can absorb their minds completely with an issue, and work it through with amazing speed and accuracy. This ability makes them outstanding trouble-shooters. Since their logical abilities are dependent on their experiences, their abilities will increase with time. They with experience are often seen as the 'gurus' of their professions. Their respect for precision in communication lends them the ability to accurately convey their ideas and discoveries in full. They are usually quite intelligent and can grasp difficult concepts. They are often jovial and good-natured, with a good sense of humor. They are not overly demanding in personal relationships, and have simple daily needs. They are often easy and enjoyable to live with. They may be exceptionally intelligent, and make ground-breaking discoveries. With a well-developed understanding of their environment and the ability to act very quickly, they may good athletes. They're typically able to communicate their ideas more concisely than the average XXXX without sacrificing accuracy. They understand the benefits of close relationships, and understand how to support and enhance these relationships. They see the value of principles that are not strictly logical They have attractive and compelling personalities, and are well-liked and accepted by most people."
INTP,"They may be exceptionally intelligent, and make ground-breaking discoveries. With a well-developed understanding of their environment and the ability to act very quickly, they may good athletes. They're typically able to communicate their ideas more concisely than the average XXXX without sacrificing accuracy. They understand the benefits of close relationships, and understand how to support and enhance these relationships. They see the value of principles that are not strictly logical They have attractive and compelling personalities, and are well-liked and accepted by most people."
INTP,"The XXXX gets 'stuck in a rut' and only does those things that are known and comfortable to the XXXX. The XXXX resists and rejects anything that doesn't support their own experiential understanding of the world. If they perceive that something is not logical, they reject it as unimportant. They reject people who think or live differently than themselves. They may be extremely caustic and insulting to others. They may become isolated from society. They may become overly paranoid about social organizations and institutions trying to control them. They may unknowingly or uncaringly hurt people's feelings. They may be completely unaware of how to express their inner world to others in a meaningful way. They may be completely unaware of the type of communication that is often desireable and (to some degree) expected in an intimate relationship. If they are aware of the kinds of things that are appropriate to say and do to foster emotional bonding, they may be unable to appreciate the value of such actions. They may feel too vulnerable to express themselves in this fashion, and so reject the entire idea. If pushed beyond their comfort level to form commitments or emotional bonds, they may reject a relationship entirely. Under stress, they may show intense emotions that seem disproportionate to the situation. They may not recognize basic social principles, such as appropriate dress and general behavior."
INTP,"Nearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be attributed in various degrees to the common XXXX problem of only taking in information that relates to or supports their own life experience. The XXXX is driven to work with and understand his or her world by applying logic (an immediate, spatial, 'fuzzy' logic) to the current situation. Although they generally seek to uncover truths, they don't always have a goal in mind to achieve from the logical process. The act or process of using logic is rewarding to the XXXX. In their zeal for the satisfaction that comes from mastering a problem or situation, They often selectively choose to put themselves in situations in which they have the opportunity to exercise these skills. That's certainly not a problem. Most personality types choose to do the things that they're best at most often. Such is the nature of capitalizing upon our strengths. The problem rears its ugly head when the goal of the XXXX becomes to achieve their personal satisfaction at all costs."
INTP,"It is healthy to choose your paths and goals in life so that they coincide with what you find rewarding, and what you're really good at. However, it sometimes happens that we take this approach a bit too far and sacrifice an accurate and objective understanding of the world for a more narrow vision that is easier and comfortable for us to deal with. The XXXX affects this problem when they stop taking in information in a truly objective sense, and instead only take in information that can be worked through logically."
INTP,"The dominant function of the XXXX is Xx. This function is supported closely and importantly by the auxiliary function of Xx. Xx perceives the world and sends information into the psyche, where it is processed by Xx. An XXXX who uses their Xx function in a diminished way is one who perceives information for the sole purpose of feeding Xx, rather than taking everything in objectively. They are less concerned with understanding something for the sake of understanding than they are with feeding a piece of data into their Thinking function. Information that is not logical is dismissed as unimportant. They may reject information that is not consistent with their logical view of themselves, or with their understanding of a situation. Well-developed Xx perceives situations with depth and global understanding. It recognizes possibilities. Xx makes conclusions. If an XXXX's psyche is serving the purposes of Xx above all else, then logical conclusions become more important than possibilities. In such cases, the XXXX picks and chooses information from Xx that is interesting to them from the perspective of reaching logical conclusions. This keeps the XXXX focused on reaching logical conclusions, but it prevents them from taking in any information that doesn't work well with their logical functioning. This includes things like love, emotions, social expectations, etc. These things are very important to many people in the world, and cannot be discarded from consideration if one hopes to really understand other people and the society that we live in. When the XXXX dismisses the importance of data that can't be handled by their Thinking function, they are dismissing the importance of ideas that are central to half of the personality types' way of life (approximately half of the human population uses Feeling primarily for decision making). An XXXX who wants to understand people and wants to recognize value in both logical and nonlogical ideas will strive to take in as much information as possible about the world for the purposes of improving their understanding,"
INTP,"The XXXX who suffers from diminished use of Xx is likely to be very cutting and derisive towards people who express disagreement with the XXXX. Without a sufficiently diverse perception of the Extraverted world, the XXXX is unlikely to understand the principles of human interaction, and is unlikely to recognize the tremendous value of getting along with others and having good relationships."
INTP,"For example, an XXXX that I know (Bob) and his wife recently adopted a 7 year old girl (Kelly). The family lives in a foreign country and make it back to the U.S. for Christmas most years. Last year, Bob's relatives from the U.S. spoiled Kelly with lots of Christmas gifts to let her know that she was welcome and valued in their family. When Bob and his family left the country after Christmas, they did not bring any of Kelly's Christmas gifts with them. Bob's relatives were all extremely hurt and upset by this fact. When they confronted Bob about this, he claimed that they were wrong. He said that he had done the packing himself and was sure that nothing had been left behind. Bob's family has a large stack of clothes and toys that were meant for Kelly, but Bob insists to this day that they are wrong. He is not seeing the situation objectively with Xx. Rather, he dismisses the evidence because it doesn't support his own vision of himself or of that particular situation."
INTP,"The XXXX's inferior (fourth) function is Xx. This means that the XXXX is not naturally in tune with how other people are feeling, or with social expectations. In fact, the XXXX is likely to reject the importance of social rituals, rules, and expectations. This is a natural weak point for the XXXX, which no doubt causes strife to the XXXX and their love partner. This weakness can be overcome by developing their Xx to the point that they can perceive Feeling type expectations in the external world. They don't have to use Xx to understand how to act in situations. They can perceive the expected behavior from their Xx function. However, if they are restricting their incoming data to only those things that support their existing way of life, then they are not learning from Xx at all. They are not growing their understanding of social and intimate behaviors - rather, they are reducing the importance of this type of understanding to their own life. In these situations, They shy away from very close personal relationships, and feel more vulnerable and less sure of themselves in situations that involve expressing their emotions. In extreme cases, they reject social interaction entirely. They tend to dislike everyone, and interact with the world with the primary purpose of getting rid of the offending person. Most They will have bad days during which they don't much feel like dealing with people. The problem occurs when every day becomes a bad day."
INTP,"To grow as an individual, the XXXX needs to focus on taking in as much information as possible through Xx. He or she needs to allow themself to get into situations that they aren't necessarily comfortable with, or that are different from the situations that they would normally choose in life. The XXXX learns from experience, so the best way for the XXXX to grow as a person is to open him or herself to new experiences. Be aware of the tendency to want to run out and do something 'new' that is actually just a different opportunity to exercise a known skill. Your task, as a person interested in personal growth, is to understand the world in a truly objective fashion, and how you fit into the world, rather than how the world fits into your life."
INTP,"The XXXX should also pay close attention to their motivations when perceiving new information. Are they perceiving with an open mind or with an agenda? Are they seeking to truly understand something, or are they more concerned with turning the information into a logical conclusion? Seek first to understand, then to judge."
INTP,"The problems that They have with regards to fitting into our world are not usually related to platonic friendships. Usually, the XXXX has trouble finding and maintaining a love relationship. The XXXX usually has relatively simple needs and expectations from their mates, and they're surprised and confused to find that their mates have more complex demands. They don't understand their mate's needs, and may feel inadequate to meeting them. They get very uncomfortable with a situation as they perceive that they are expected to do something that it unknown to them. They back away from the relationship. They generally mask their fear and discomfort by reducing the importance of the relationship to themselves and others, or by putting the failure off onto the ridiculous expectations of their ex-mate. Outside of a relationship, they feel more unloved and unappreciated, but are afraid to commit to a relationship because they fear rejection and hurt."
INTP,"Most They experience relationship difficulties at some point in their lives. The XXXX with a well-developed Xx will find relationships more satisfying and easier to deal with. Accordingly, we offer some general suggestions for dealing with relationships, as well as some advice that will help the XXXX develop their Xx."
ENFJ,"As an XXXX, you're primary mode of living is focused externally, where you deal with things according to how you feel about them, or how they fit into your personal value system. Your secondary mode is internal, where you take things in primarily via your intuition."
ENFJ,"They are people-focused individuals. They live in the world of people possibilities. More so than any other type, they have excellent people skills. They understand and care about people, and have a special talent for bringing out the best in others. XXXX's main interest in life is giving love, support, and a good time to other people. They are focused on understanding, supporting, and encouraging others. They make things happen for people, and get their best personal satisfaction from this."
ENFJ,"Because XXXX's people skills are so extraordinary, they have the ability to make people do exactly what they want them to do. They get under people's skins and get the reactions that they are seeking. XXXX's motives are usually unselfish, but They who have developed less than ideally have been known to use their power over people to manipulate them."
ENFJ,"XXXX's are so externally focused that it's especially important for them to spend time alone. This can be difficult for some They, because they have the tendency to be hard on themselves and turn to dark thoughts when alone. Consequently, They might avoid being alone, and fill their lives with activities involving other people. They tend to define their life's direction and priorities according to other people's needs, and may not be aware of their own needs. It's natural to their personality type that they will tend to place other people's needs above their own, but they need to stay aware of their own needs so that they don't sacrifice themselves in their drive to help others."
ENFJ,"XXXX's tend to be more reserved about exposing themselves than other extraverted types. Although they may have strongly-felt beliefs, they're likely to refrain from expressing them if doing so would interfere with bringing out the best in others. Because their strongest interest lies in being a catalyst of change in other people, they're likely to interact with others on their own level, in a chameleon-like manner, rather than as individuals."
ENFJ,"Which is not to say that the XXXX does not have opinions. They have definite values and opinions which they're able to express clearly and succinctly. These beliefs will be expressed as long as they're not too personal. XXXX is in many ways expressive and open, but is more focused on being responsive and supportive of others. When faced with a conflict between a strongly-held value and serving another person's need, they are highly likely to value the other person's needs."
ENFJ,"The XXXX may feel quite lonely even when surrounded by people. This feeling of aloneness may be exacerbated by the tendency to not reveal their true selves."
ENFJ,"People love They. They are fun to be with, and truly understand and love people. They are typically very straight-forward and honest. Usually They exude a lot of self-confidence, and have a great amount of ability to do many different things. They are generally bright, full of potential, energetic and fast-paced. They are usually good at anything which captures their interest."
ENFJ,"They like for things to be well-organized, and will work hard at maintaining structure and resolving ambiguity. They have a tendency to be fussy, especially with their home environments."
ENFJ,"In the work place, They do well in positions where they deal with people. They are naturals for the social committee. Their uncanny ability to understand people and say just what needs to be said to make them happy makes them naturals for counseling. They enjoy being the center of attention, and do very well in situations where they can inspire and lead others, such as teaching."
ENFJ,"They do not like dealing with impersonal reasoning. They don't understand or appreciate its merit, and will be unhappy in situations where they're forced to deal with logic and facts without any connection to a human element. Living in the world of people possibilities, they enjoy their plans more than their achievements. They get excited about possibilities for the future, but may become easily bored and restless with the present."
ENFJ,"They have a special gift with people, and are basically happy people when they can use that gift to help others. They get their best satisfaction from serving others. Their genuine interest in Humankind and their exceptional intuitive awareness of people makes them able to draw out even the most reserved individuals."
ENFJ,"They have a strong need for close, intimate relationships, and will put forth a lot of effort in creating and maintaining these relationships. They're very loyal and trustworthy once involved in a relationship."
ENFJ,"An XXXX who has not developed their Feeling side may have difficulty making good decisions, and may rely heavily on other people in decision-making processes. If they have not developed their Intuition, they may not be able to see possibilities, and will judge things too quickly based on established value systems or social rules, without really understanding the current situation. An XXXX who has not found their place in the world is likely to be extremely sensitive to criticism, and to have the tendency to worry excessively and feel guilty. They are also likely to be very manipulative and controling with others."
ENFJ,"In general, They are charming, warm, gracious, creative and diverse individuals with richly developed insights into what makes other people tick. This special ability to see growth potential in others combined with a genuine drive to help people makes the XXXX a truly valued individual. As giving and caring as the XXXX is, they need to remember to value their own needs as well as the needs of others. . Genuinely and warmly interested in people. Value people's feelings. Value structure and organization. Value harmony, and good at creating it. Exceptionally good people skills. Dislike impersonal logic and analysis. Strong organizational capabilities. Loyal and honest. Creative and imaginative. Enjoy variety and new challenges. Get personal satisfaction from helping others. Extremely sensitive to criticism and discord. Need approval from others to feel good about themselves "
ENFJ,"The flexibility of these characteristics leave the XXXX a lot of leeway in choosing a profession. As long as they're in a supportive environment in which they can work with people and are presented with sufficient diverse challenges to stimulate their creativity, they should do very well.. Facilitator. Consultant. Psychologist. Social Worker. Counselor. Teacher. Clergy. Sales Representative. Human Resources. Manager. Events Coordinator. Sales Representative. Politician. Diplomat. Writer"
ENFJ,"They put a lot of effort and enthusiasm into their relationships. To some extent, the XXXX defines themself by the closeness and authenticity of their personal relationships, and are therefore highly invested in the business of relationships. They have very good people skills, and are affectionate and considerate. They are warmly affirming and nurturing. The excel at bringing out the best in others, and warmly supporting them. They want responding affirmation from their relationships, although they have a problem asking for it. When a situation calls for it, the XXXX will become very sharp and critical. After having made their point, they will return to their natural, warm selves. They may have a tendency to 'smother' their loved ones, but are generally highly valued for their genuine warmth and caring natures.. Good verbal communication skills. Very perceptive about people's thoughts and motives. Motivational, inspirational; bring out the best in others. Warmly affectionate and affirming. Fun to be with - lively sense of humor, dramatic, energetic, optimistic. Good money skills. Able to 'move on' after a love relationship has failed (although they blame themselves). Loyal and committed - they want lifelong relationships. Strive for 'win-win' situations. Driven to meet other's needs . Tendency to be smothering and over-protective. Tendency to be controling and/or manipulative. Don't pay enough attention to their own needs. Tend to be critical of opinions and attitudes which don't match their own. Sometimes unaware of social appropriateness or protocol. Extremely sensitive to conflict, with a tendency to sweep things under the rug as an avoidance tactic. Tendency to blame themselves when things go wrong, and not give themselves credit when things go right. Their sharply defined value systems make them unbending in some areas. They may be so attuned to what is socially accepted or expected that they're unable to assess whether something is 'right' or 'wrong' outside of what their social circle expects."
ENFJ,"They make warm, committed lovers who are willing to go to great lengths for the sake of 'The Relationship'. They're totally dedicated to the relationship, and to their partner, and have a special skill for warmth and affirmation which brings out the best in their mates. They take their commitments seriously, and are likely to put forth a lot of effort into making a relationship work once they have commited themselves to it. In the event that a relationship fails, the XXXX will feel a lot of guilt, and take on blame for the failure, but they will move on with their lives with relative ease, without looking backwards."
ENFJ,"Since relationships are central to the XXXX's life, they will be very 'hands on' and involved with their intimate relationships. They may be in the habit of constantly asking their partner how they're doing, what they're feeling, etc. This behavior may be a bit smothering, but it also supports a strong awareness of the health (or illness) of the relationship."
ENFJ,"Sexually, the XXXX looks forward to intimacy as an opportunity to express love and caring. The XXXX is generally very interested in the happiness and satisfaction of their partner. Because they achieve much of their personal satisfaction from making others happy, they're likely to be skilled lovers. Like other Judgers, the XXXX is likely to follow a schedule for intimacy, and may be prone to becoming routinized. For the XXXX, the most important aspect of a sexual encounter is the affirmation of love and affection."
ENFJ,"Although the XXXX will probably not ask for it, they need to be given sweet words and loving affirmation. Since they are so externally focused on serving people, they do not always pay attention to their own needs. Since much of their personal satisfaction comes from bringing happiness to others, they're able to ignore their own needs and still be happy much more easily than other types. However, if they focus entirely on giving without doing some taking, they may find themselves in an unhealthy, unbalanced relationship. They need to work on being aware of their needs, and being OK with verbalizing those needs to their partners."
ENFJ,"problem area for They in relationships is their very serious dislike of conflict. They will prefer to brush issues under the rug rather than confront them head-on, if there is likely to be a conflict. They are also likely to 'give in' easily in conflict situations, just to end the conflict. They might agree to something which goes against their values just to end the uncomfortable situation. In such cases, the problem is extended and will return at a later time. The XXXX needs to realize that the world will not end if there is a disagreement, and that dealing with things immediately initiates closure. Ignoring issues will not make them go away."
ENFJ,"In general, the XXXX is intensely and enthusiastically involved in their personal relationships. They bring fun and warmth into the equation, and are willing to work hard to make things work."
ENFJ,"They take their parenting role very seriously. They consider the task of passing on values and goals to their children as paramount, and will strive to consistently be a good role model to their children. The XXXX considers it their responsibility to make sure that their children turn out well. This characteristic, combined with the XXXX's definite values and ideas about the way things should be, usually results in the XXXX parent being rather strict, and having high expectations for the behavior of their children. On the other hand, the XXXX is also warm and affectionate with their children, and very supportive and affirming. The XXXX can also be counted on to take care of day-to-day necessities for their children."
ENFJ,"It is not usually easy to be the child of an XXXX. The XXXX's life focus is centered in the sphere of relationships. They take their relationship roles very seriously. They are very 'hands-on' in relationships, always monitoring it's progress. This behavior may be smothering to some individuals. They have very definite value systems, and well-defined ideas about what is right and what is wrong. Since they believe that part of their parental role involves passing their values and ideas to their children, and since they are so concerned and involved with their children, the XXXX has a tendency to be a strict, controling parent, who is very aware of their children's actions. The XXXX needs to remember to allow their children the room for growth which is necessary if they are to evolve into healthy, well-adjusted adults. With a bit of effort, it will be possible for the XXXX to balance their need to pass their values and ideals down to their children with their children's need to develop as individuals."
ENFJ,"The XXXX will put forth a good amount of effort to make their children's home environment warm, comforting and cheerful. They will be ready with a kiss and a baid-aid for any hurt. Their normal attitude towards their children will be loyal, proud, warm, and affirming."
ENFJ,"As is the case with most types, XXXX parents may have problems with their children as they reach puberty. Their children will need more space at that age, and will begin to resent the over-protective tendencies of the XXXX. This problem will be magnified in situations where the XXXX is very manipulative. Since They are gifted with exceptional people skills and personal presence, some XXXX individuals who are not supported by life's circumstances get into the habit of using these skills for personal gain to get what they want or need out of situations. As they grow older, their children will inevitably see the manipulative tendencies for what they are, and will begin to question their parents' value systems, and strongly resent being forced to comply with a set of values which may be somewhat hippocritical. The manipulative XXXX, who still has strongly-held values which they are driven to pass to their children, may then find themselves 'a day late and a dollar short'. As an XXXX, your best bet is to be aware of your type's manipulative tendancies and to make every effort that you are not using them in a negative way."
ENFJ,"Usually, the XXXX has nothing but the best intentions with regards to their children. They are remembered by their children as very warm and supportive (although strict), and are valued for passing on their goals and ideals."
ENFJ,"They are warm, sociable people who are keenly in tune with other people's feelings and perspectives. They enjoy supporting and bringing out the best in others. They are energetic and fun to be with. They seek authenticity in their close relationships, and are very sensitive to the needs of others. All of these characteristics make the XXXX valued by their peers as a warm, supportive and giving friend."
ENFJ,"They are interested in all sorts of people, and are likely to be able to understand and relate to all of the personality types. The will excel at getting along with all sorts of people when the situation demands that they do so. However, they will not choose to spend their personal time around all of the types. They may resist spending a lot of time with Sensing Perceiving types, whose carefree 'live for the moment' attitude may conflict with the XXXX's strongly held value system. When seeking companionship that is not romantic, They will be drawn to other Feelers who have similar values and ideas. Since they live in a people-oriented world, they are not comfortable with objective judgments which do not consider people issues. Consequently, They are not likely to have close friendships with strong Thinking types. They will be likely to especially enjoy the company of other iNtuitive Feelers, as well as Sensing Judgers."
ENFJ,"They are motivated by external human situations, primarily by other people; their talents, their needs, their aspirations and their cares forming the world in which an XXXX lives. They thrive when able to 'make things right' for others, to enable and empower their co-workers, friends and family through valuing their human strengths and abilities. When gifted with the added XXXX ability to intuitively adapt their feelings to the way they are affected by others, the XXXX has a positive drive to find co-operative pathways leading to the best possible outcome for all, including themselves. Success for an XXXX comes through involvement in the process of making things happen for people; through the accomplishments and satisfactions of those they have helped to enrich the human world with greater value, and through finding that their efforts on behalf of others have fulfilled their own life as well.. Making others feel valued and important. Quickly seeing the positive and negative aspects of a human situation. Expressing their feelings clearly. Offering loyalty and commitment to partners, family and work mates. Trying to always find the solution which works for everyone. Encouraging humour and self expression in others. Finding ways to help others fulfil their needs. Affirming positive community values. Naturally falling into leadership roles within their community . Understanding and empathising with the feelings of others; realizing 'where they are coming from'. A talent for creative expression which can turn ordinary things and situations into something magical. An enhanced feeling of connection with and sensitivity toward the world around them.. The ability to see many facets of a problem and the many ways it might be resolved for the best.. The ability to make creative and valuable use of time spent alone.. Openness to the spiritual connections between all things.. They become increasingly creative, visionary and empathetic, and are therefore effective and kind managers of businesses, people, and various situations that life presents."
ENFJ,"With any gift of strength, there is an associated weakness. Without 'bad', there would be no 'good'. Without 'difficult', there would be no 'easy'. We value our strengths, but we often curse and ignore our weaknesses. To grow as a person and get what we want out of life, we must not only capitalize upon our strengths, but also face our weaknesses and deal with them. That means taking a hard look at our personality type's potential problem areas."
ENFJ,"Most of the weaker characteristics found in They are due to their dominant Xx overvaluing what they see as objective values in the external world and thereby judging too much by the needs of others, or by appearances. This is primarily due to the XXXX having not fully adapted their Introverted Intuitive function sufficiently for them to be able to discern the vast range of ways in which they might be being missing the underlying needs within themselves and being misled by such appearances. The XXXX naturally looks outward to find value and satisfaction, and whilst it is essential that this direction be taken to fulfil their primary needs of relation and comfort, without the supportive balance of a well developed Intuitive function, They can overvalue the external world to the point where they lose sight of themselves, becoming fixed in their judgements about people and the world. In such cases, the XXXX will tend to live in a rigid - and to others, somewhat surreal - world of definite values which often seems 'overstated' or obsessively connected to other people or human situations."
ENFJ,"Nearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be attributed in various degrees to the common XXXX problem of wanting to find the 'proper' value in everything. If the XXXX does not learn how to see beneath the appearance of what they quickly judge as good or bad about the people and situations in their external environment, they will only use their Xx to support those judgements they feel are good for them and disregard not only other possibilities but their own quality of inner life as well. The consideration of these less obvious possibilities and their own needs requires that the XXXX recognize that their own value judgements are indeed subjective, and that it is not appropriate or effective to apply them across the board to all civilized people. The practice of standing back and looking objectively at their own value system is not something that the XXXX is accustomed to doing; trying to avoid abstract rationalisation of problems and the feelings they engender is a natural survival technique for the XXXX personality. The main driver to the XXXX personality is Xx, whose purpose is above all to find and discriminate the values in people and human situations. If their ability to find a specific and worthy value in a person or situation is threatened, the XXXX shuts out the threatening force. This is totally natural, but unfortunately the individual who exercises this type of agenda protection regularly will become more and more rigid in their judgements and expectations of people, but even less concerned with the effect such conditions have upon themselves. Where the unbalanced XXXX does acquiesce to the images of intuition, these will generally be skewed to support the subjective agenda of dominant Feeling. In this way they always find justification for their determinations and their self sacrifices to people, things and situations, and they will be unable locate the reality of another's true feelings, nor be interested in discovering that their seemingly objective judgements miss the reasons and subjectivities underlying both their own and others lives or worldly situation."
ENFJ,"Petulance, pensiveness and a sense of being let down by others can often be the end result of this one sided approach to the world, whilst if the XXXX is in a strong company or relationship position they might become driven to manipulate others and situations to conform to their own feeling needs and value judgements, irrespective of any true value to the situation or for the other persons involved. In this case, the 'big picture' valued for its great worth to all, becomes a dominant drive which seeks to blot out or crush any opposition by claiming the moral high ground, even to the point where the XXXX sacrifices their own life to the 'cause'. The inability to recognize the plethora of subjective possibilities their feelings bring into their lives strip the unbalanced XXXX of their access to both a deeper connection with others and the possibility of refining and developing pathways to the kind of self understanding and self nurturing their finer judgements might otherwise lead them to."
ENFJ,"To grow as an individual, the XXXX needs to focus on paying attention to their inner images. This means they need to be open to the possibilities that lie beneath their judgements and values, rather than just accepting the appearance of values which accord with their sense of rightness. The XXXX needs to understand that developing their ability to see the subjective possibilities within themselves and others does not threaten their ability to make correct judgements, but rather enhances it, and enhances their personal chances for achieving a measure of success in their lives."
ENFJ,"The XXXX concerned with personal growth will pay close attention to their motivation for accepting values that come to them. Are they trying to see the background of circumstance behind their own and others value judgements, or are they trying to maintain their own image of how things 'ought' to be? The goal is to find a balance between what seems correct and valuable and the many possible ways in which such a judgement might be subjective and not necessarily the best for themselves or a situation. Obviously, this is not entirely possible, but it is the exercise to keep in mind. They need to see the many divergent images of values and their conflicts which affect them, without feeling threatened, and without losing their sense of what is right and wrong."
ENFJ,"As can be seen from the above, some strongly expressed They can have difficulty fitting into society. Their problems are usually due to their Xx function being so dominant that they are so strongly bound to what they see as objective values that they cannot relate to the world except via the objects of their feeling. In such cases the intensity of their judgements can actually drive others away from them, and the resulting lack of close relationship felt as a personal failing for which the XXXX feels guilty. Such guilt can drive even more strongly affective behaviour which leads the XXXX to ignore their own needs entirely, or it can become a negative drive to manipulate others to conform to their one-sided vision of the world. The XXXX who consistently tries to see the underlying possibilities and the scope available in each situation will be able to see the right path to take with each person and situation in their life. This will always lead them to toward closer relationships, happiness and great achievements."
INFJ,"As an XXXX, your primary mode of living is focused internally, where you take things in primarily via intuition. Your secondary mode is external, where you deal with things according to how you feel about them, or how they fit with your personal value system."
INFJ,"They are gentle, caring, complex and highly intuitive individuals. Artistic and creative, they live in a world of hidden meanings and possibilities. Only one percent of the population has an XXXX Personality Type, making it the most rare of all the types."
INFJ,"They place great importance on havings things orderly and systematic in their outer world. They put a lot of energy into identifying the best system for getting things done, and constantly define and re-define the priorities in their lives. On the other hand, They operate within themselves on an intuitive basis which is entirely spontaneous. They know things intuitively, without being able to pinpoint why, and without detailed knowledge of the subject at hand. They are usually right, and they usually know it. Consequently, They put a tremendous amount of faith into their instincts and intuitions. This is something of a conflict between the inner and outer worlds, and may result in the XXXX not being as organized as other Judging types tend to be. Or we may see some signs of disarray in an otherwise orderly tendency, such as a consistently messy desk."
INFJ,"They have uncanny insight into people and situations. They get 'feelings' about things and intuitively understand them. As an extreme example, some They report experiences of a psychic nature, such as getting strong feelings about there being a problem with a loved one, and discovering later that they were in a car accident. This is the sort of thing that other types may scorn and scoff at, and the XXXX themself does not really understand their intuition at a level which can be verbalized. Consequently, most They are protective of their inner selves, sharing only what they choose to share when they choose to share it. They are deep, complex individuals, who are quite private and typically difficult to understand. They hold back part of themselves, and can be secretive."
INFJ,"But the XXXX is as genuinely warm as they are complex. They hold a special place in the heart of people who they are close to, who are able to see their special gifts and depth of caring. They are concerned for people's feelings, and try to be gentle to avoid hurting anyone. They are very sensitive to conflict, and cannot tolerate it very well. Situations which are charged with conflict may drive the normally peaceful XXXX into a state of agitation or charged anger. They may tend to internalize conflict into their bodies, and experience health problems when under a lot of stress."
INFJ,"Because the XXXX has such strong intuitive capabilities, they trust their own instincts above all else. This may result in an XXXX stubborness and tendency to ignore other people's opinions. They believe that they're right. On the other hand, XXXX is a perfectionist who doubts that they are living up to their full potential. They are rarely at complete peace with themselves - there's always something else they should be doing to improve themselves and the world around them. They believe in constant growth, and don't often take time to revel in their accomplishments. They have strong value systems, and need to live their lives in accordance with what they feel is right. In deference to the Feeling aspect of their personalities, They are in some ways gentle and easy going. Conversely, they have very high expectations of themselves, and frequently of their families. They don't believe in compromising their ideals."
INFJ,"XXXX is a natural nurturer; patient, devoted and protective. They make loving parents and usually have strong bonds with their offspring. They have high expectations of their children, and push them to be the best that they can be. This can sometimes manifest itself in the XXXX being hard-nosed and stubborn. But generally, children of an XXXX get devoted and sincere parental guidance, combined with deep caring."
INFJ,"In the workplace, the XXXX usually shows up in areas where they can be creative and somewhat independent. They have a natural affinity for art, and many excel in the sciences, where they make use of their intuition. They can also be found in service-oriented professions. They are not good at dealing with minutia or very detailed tasks. The XXXX will either avoid such things, or else go to the other extreme and become enveloped in the details to the extent that they can no longer see the big picture. An XXXX who has gone the route of becoming meticulous about details may be highly critical of other individuals who are not."
INFJ,"The XXXX individual is gifted in ways that other types are not. Life is not necessarily easy for the XXXX, but they are capable of great depth of feeling and personal achievement. . Intuitively understand people and situations. Idealistic. Highly principled. Complex and deep. Natural leaders. Sensitive and compassionate towards people. Service-oriented. Future-oriented. Value deep, authentic relationships. Reserved about expressing their true selves. Dislike dealing with details unless they enhance or promote their vision. Constantly seeking meaning and purpose in everything. Creative and visionary. Intense and tightly-wound. Can work logically and rationally - use their intuition to understand the goal and work backwards towards it "
INFJ,"The XXXX is a special individual who needs more out of a career than a job. They need to feel as if everything they do in their lives is in sync with their strong value systems - with what they believe to be right. Accordingly, the XXXX should choose a career in which they're able to live their daily lives in accordance with their deeply-held principles, and that supports them in their life quest to be doing something meaningful. Since They have such strong value systems, and persistent intuitive visions that lend them a sense of 'knowing', they do best in positions in which they are leaders, rather than followers. Although they can happily follow individuals who are leading in a direction that the XXXX fully supports, they will very unhappy following in any other situation.. Clergy / Religious Work. Teachers. Medical Doctors / Dentists. Alternative Health Care Practitioners, i.e. Chiropractor, Reflexologist. Psychologists. Psychiatrists. Counselors and Social Workers. Musicians and Artists. Photographers. Child Care / Early Childhood Development"
INFJ,"They are warm and affirming people who are usually also deep and complex. They're likely to seek out and promote relationships that are intense and meaningful. They tend to be perfectionists, and are always striving for the Ultimate Relationship. For the most part, this is a positive feature, but sometimes works against the XXXX if they fall into the habit of moving from relationship to relationship, always in search of a more perfect partner. In general, the XXXX is a deeply warm and caring person who is highly invested in the health of their close relationships, and puts forth a lot of effort to make them positive. They are valued by those close to them for these special qualities. They seek long-term, lifelong relationships, although they don't always find them. . Warm and affirming by nature. Dedicated to achieving the ultimate relationship. Sensitive and concerned for others' feelings. Usually have good communication skills, especially written. Take their commitments very seriously, and seek lifelong relationships. Have very high expectations for themselves and others (both a strength and weakness). Good listeners. Are able to move on after a relationship has ended (once they're sure it's over) . Tendency to hold back part of themselves. Not good with money or practical day-to-day life necessities. Extreme dislike of conflict and criticism. Have very high expectations for themselves and others (both a strength and weakness). Have difficulty leaving a bad relationship "
INFJ,"They are warm, considerate partners who feel great depth of love for their partners. They enjoy showing this love, and want to receive affirmation back from their mates."
INFJ,"They are perfectionists, constantly striving to achieve the Perfect Relationship. This can sometimes be frustrating to their mates, who may feel put upon by the They demanding perfectionism. However, it may also be greatly appreciated, because it indicates a sincere commitment to the relationship, and a depth of caring which is not usually present in other types."
INFJ,"Sexually, They view intimacy as a nearly spiritual experience. They embrace the opportunity to bond heart and soul with their mates. As service-oriented individuals, it's very important to them that their mates are happy. Intimacy is an opportunity for the XXXX to selflessly give their love, and experience it in a tangible way."
INFJ,"They usually make warm and caring parents. Their goal is to help their children become adults who know the difference between right and wrong, and who are independent, growth-oriented individuals."
INFJ,"Along the path to that goal they are generally very warm and caring, and are likely to treat their children as individuals who have a voice in family decisions. They want their children to be able to think for themselves, and make the right decisions. They also can be quite demanding on their children, and may have very high expectations for their behavior. Although they are generally soft-spoken and gentle, they may become stubborn and sharp-tongued at times when their expectations aren't met, or when under a lot of stress."
INFJ,"They take their parenting role with ultimate seriousness. They will make sacrifices for the sake of their children without a second thought, and without remorse. Passing on their values to their children is a serious priority in their lives. Children of They remember their parents fondly as warm, patient, and inspirational."
INFJ,"Although the XXXX is likely to put friends behind their God and their families in terms of importance, they do value their friendships. As idealists who have strong value systems, They seek authenticity and depth in their close relationships, and especially value people who can see and appreciate the XXXX for who they are and what they stand for."
INFJ,"The XXXX is likely to spend a lot of time socialing with family members. If they are religious, they probably are social with members of their religious community. After that, the XXXX may have friends represented from any of the personality types. They are usually extremely intuitive individuals, who will have no patience for anyone they feel is dishonest or corrupt. They'll have no interest in being around these kinds of people."
INFJ,"All kinds of people are drawn towards the XXXX. They are usually quite popular, although they may be unaware of it themselves, because they don't place a lot of importance on it."
INFJ,"The XXXX is valued by their close friends for their warmth and consideration, their new and interesting ways of looking at things, and for their ability to inspire and motivate others to be the best that they can be."
INFJ,"People with the XXXX personality type are intense and perfectionistic. They have deep insights into many aspects of life, and usually have very high standards for their own understanding and accomplishments, as well as those of others. They are service-oriented and empathetic to other individuals. The XXXX strives for the ideal in every aspect of their life. An XXXX's feeling of success is centered around their own level of understanding and accomplishment, their usefulness or service to others, and the condition of their personal relationships. The XXXX feels successful when they have used their very deep understanding of something to do a real service for someone. We often see XXXX personality types as counsellors and teachers, or in the medical and health fields."
INFJ,"They're extremely insightful, and see things that are not obvious to others. This ability to see patterns and meanings in the world can help the XXXX in many different ways. They usually have a great deal of insight into different people and situations. When given a goal or context, an XXXX is able to generate all kinds of possibilities. They're able to see the problem from many different angles. They understand how others are feeling, and are genuinely concerned with others. This natural empathy and caring helps to be really effective at helping others through problems. In this manner, they make great friends, counselors, teachers, and mates. An XXXX has a 'stick to it' attitude. They're not afraid of hard work, and will put forth a great deal of effort towards something that they believe in. This persistence will help the XXXX to achieve an identified goal. Perfectionistic and idealistic, they always strive for the best. Usually intelligent and able to concentrate and focus, the XXXX can usually grasp difficult ideas and concepts."
INFJ,"They can turn their insightful understanding about a situation into a successful plan of action. The XXXX with well-developed judgment will be able to grasp and process concepts that are beyond what their natural intelligence appears to be able to handle. They may achieve a level of understanding that makes them appear wise. The XXXX's perfectionism and idealism, when combined with their empathy and genuine concern for others, can cause them to be true servants for people in some fashion. They may be great doctors or ministers or counselors. If they have also achieved a good amount of life wisdom, they can become powerful forces, such as Jesus (XXXX) and Mahatma Ghandi (XXXX)."
INFJ,"They are rare and intelligent people with many special gifts. This should be kept in mind as you read some of the more negative material about XXXX weaknesses. Remember that these weaknesses are natural. We offer this information to enact positive change, rather than as blatant criticism. We want you to grow into your full potential, and be the happiest and most successful person that you can become."
INFJ,"May be unaware (and sometimes uncaring) of how they come across to others May quickly dismiss input from others without really considering it May apply their judgment more often towards others, rather than towards themselves With their ability to see an issue from many sides, they may always find others at fault for any problems in their lives May have unrealistic and/or unreasonable expectations of others May be intolerant of weaknesses in others May believe that they're always right May be obsessive and passionate about details that may be unimportant to the big picture May be cuttingly derisive and sarcastic towards others May have an intense and quick temper May be tense, wound up, have high blood pressure and find it difficult to relax May hold grudges, and have difficulty forgiving people May be wishy-washy and unsure how to act in situations that require quick decision making May have difficulty communicating their thoughts and feelings to others May see so many tangents everywhere that they can't stay focused on the bottom line or the big picture"
INFJ,"Most of the problems described above are a result of Xx overtaking the XXXX's personality to the point that all of the other functions become slaves to Xx. A healthy personality needs to have a good balance between its dominant and auxiliary functions. For an XXXX, the dominant Xx needs to be well-supported by the auxiliary Xx function. If Xx exists only to support the desires of Xx, then neither function is being used to its potential."
INFJ,"Xx is a personality function that constantly gathers information, and sees everything from many different perspectives. As the dominant player in a personality, it has the effect of constantly bombarding the psyche with new information to consider. Xx is sort of like a framework for understanding that exists in the mind. As something is perceived, it is melded into the existing intuitive framework. If an entirely new piece of information is perceived by the Introverted iNtuitive, that person must redefine their entire framework of reference. So, Introverted iNtuitives are constantly taking in information about the world that needs to be processed in a relatively lengthy manner in order to be understood. That presents quite a challenge to the XXXX. It's not unusual for an XXXX to feel overwhelmed with all of the things that he or she needs to consider in order to fully understand an idea or situation."
INFJ,"When Xx dominates the XXXX such that the other functions cannot serve their own purposes, we find the XXXX cutting off information that it needs to consider. If the psyche is presented with information that looks anything like something that Xx has processed in the past, it uses Xx to quickly reject that information. The psyche uses Xx to reject the ideas, rather than taking the information into its intuitive framework, and therefore potentially causing that framework to be reshaped and redefined."
INFJ,"Using Xx in this manner may effectively serve the immediate needs of Xx, but it is not ideal. It causes the XXXX to not consider information that may be useful or criticial in developing a real understanding of an issue. It may cause the XXXX to come off as too strongly opinionated or snobbish to others."
INFJ,"The better use of Xx for an XXXX would be to use it to assess the XXXX's rich insights and weigh them against the external world. When the XXXX personality uses Xx to cut off incoming information, rather than to judge internal intuitions, it is effectively cheating itself. It's like getting the answers to a test without having to really understand the questions. It's easier to get the answer right away, rather than to have to figure everything out. For the XXXX, who has a tremendous amount of information and 'studying' that needs to be done, it's very tempting to take shortcuts. Most They will do this to some extent. The real problems occur when an XXXX personality has become so imbalanced that its owner is extremely self-important and rarely consider anyone else's opinions or ideas."
INFJ,"To grow as an individual, the XXXX needs to focus on applying their judgment to things only after they have gone through their intuition. In other words, the XXXX needs to consciously try not to use their judgment to dismiss ideas prematurely. Rather, they should use their judgment against their own ideas. One cannot effectively judge something that they don't understand. The XXXX needs to take things entirely into their intuition in order to understand them. It may be neccesary to give your intuition enough time to work through the new information so that it can rebuild its global framework of understanding. They need to focus on using their judgment not to dismiss ideas, but rather to support their intuitive framework."
INFJ,"An XXXX who is concerned with personal growth will pay close attention to the subject of their judgments, and their motivation for making judgments. Are they judging something external to themself, or are they judging something that they have sifted through their intuition? Is the motivation for judging something to be able to understand its usefulness in the world, or to dismiss it? Too often, an XXXX will judge something without properly understanding it, and with the intention of dismissing it. Seek first to understand, then to judge."
INFJ,"Some They have difficulty fitting into our society. Their problems are generally associated with not knowing (or caring) how they come across to others, and with having unreasonable expectations for others' behaviors. Both of these issues stem from using Xx primarily to dismiss external ideas, rather than to sort through their own intuitions."
INFJ,"An XXXX who uses Xx in this diminished manner may become so strongly opinionated that they form rigid and unreasonable expectations for others. They may feel so strongly about things that they become very passionate and agitated when they feel that something has gone wrong. In these cases, it's not uncommon for the XXXX to express their displeasure with biting sarcasm. They become so emotionally upset that they are generally not aware of how their behavior comes across to others. Even if the consequences of their attitude and behavior is pointed out to them, they may be agitated to the point that they don't care. This kind of situation can be devastating to the XXXX on many levels, and should be avoided. There isn't much that can be done once the XXXX has reached the point where they are too upset to care about others, but the XXXX can prevent this problem from occuring by ensuring that they never get to that point."
INFJ,"How can you, as an XXXX, ensure that you won't get that upset? It probably seems to you that these kinds of upsets are caused by external circumstances and situations. Well, that's not really true. It's true that things will happen over which you have no control. But you certainly have control over how you perceive these things, or more appropriately, how you *judge* these things."
ENFP,"As an XXXX, your primary mode of living is focused externally, where you take things in primarily via your intuition. Your secondary mode is internal, where you deal with things according to how you feel about them, or how they fit in with your personal value system."
ENFP,"They are warm, enthusiastic people, typically very bright and full of potential. They live in the world of possibilities, and can become very passionate and excited about things. Their enthusiasm lends them the ability to inspire and motivate others, more so than we see in other types. They can talk their way in or out of anything. They love life, seeing it as a special gift, and strive to make the most out of it."
ENFP,"They have an unusually broad range of skills and talents. They are good at most things which interest them. Project-oriented, they may go through several different careers during their lifetime. To onlookers, the XXXX may seem directionless and without purpose, but They are actually quite consistent, in that they have a strong sense of values which they live with throughout their lives. Everything that they do must be in line with their values. An XXXX needs to feel that they are living their lives as their true Self, walking in step with what they believe is right. They see meaning in everything, and are on a continuous quest to adapt their lives and values to achieve inner peace. They're constantly aware and somewhat fearful of losing touch with themselves. Since emotional excitement is usually an important part of the XXXX's life, and because they are focused on keeping 'centered', the XXXX is usually an intense individual, with highly evolved values."
ENFP,"An XXXX needs to focus on following through with their projects. This can be a problem area for some of these individuals. Unlike other Extraverted types, They need time alone to center themselves, and make sure they are moving in a direction which is in sync with their values. They who remain centered will usually be quite successful at their endeavors. Others may fall into the habit of dropping a project when they become excited about a new possibility, and thus they never achieve the great accomplishments which they are capable of achieving."
ENFP,"Most They have great people skills. They are genuinely warm and interested in people, and place great importance on their inter-personal relationships. They almost always have a strong need to be liked. Sometimes, especially at a younger age, an XXXX will tend to be 'gushy' and insincere, and generally 'overdo' in an effort to win acceptance. However, once an XXXX has learned to balance their need to be true to themselves with their need for acceptance, they excel at bringing out the best in others, and are typically well-liked. They have an exceptional ability to intuitively understand a person after a very short period of time, and use their intuition and flexibility to relate to others on their own level."
ENFP,"Because They live in the world of exciting possibilities, the details of everyday life are seen as trivial drudgery. They place no importance on detailed, maintenance-type tasks, and will frequently remain oblivous to these types of concerns. When they do have to perform these tasks, they do not enjoy themselves. This is a challenging area of life for most They, and can be frustrating for XXXX's family members."
ENFP,"An XXXX who has 'gone wrong' may be quite manipulative - and very good it. The gift of gab which they are blessed with makes it naturally easy for them to get what they want. Most They will not abuse their abilities, because that would not jive with their value systems."
ENFP,"They sometimes make serious errors in judgment. They have an amazing ability to intuitively perceive the truth about a person or situation, but when they apply judgment to their perception, they may jump to the wrong conclusions."
ENFP,"They who have not learned to follow through may have a difficult time remaining happy in marital relationships. Always seeing the possibilities of what could be, they may become bored with what actually is. The strong sense of values will keep many They dedicated to their relationships. However, They like a little excitement in their lives, and are best matched with individuals who are comfortable with change and new experiences."
ENFP,"Having an XXXX parent can be a fun-filled experience, but may be stressful at times for children with strong Sensing or Judging tendancies. Such children may see the XXXX parent as inconsistent and difficult to understand, as the children are pulled along in the whirlwind life of the XXXX. Sometimes the XXXX will want to be their child's best friend, and at other times they will play the parental authoritarian. But They are always consistent in their value systems, which they will impress on their children above all else, along with a basic joy of living."
ENFP,"They are basically happy people. They may become unhappy when they are confined to strict schedules or mundane tasks. Consequently, They work best in situations where they have a lot of flexibility, and where they can work with people and ideas. Many go into business for themselves. They have the ability to be quite productive with little supervision, as long as they are excited about what they're doing."
ENFP,"Because they are so alert and sensitive, constantly scanning their environments, They often suffer from muscle tension. They have a strong need to be independent, and resist being controlled or labelled. They need to maintain control over themselves, but they do not believe in controlling others. Their dislike of dependence and suppression extends to others as well as to themselves."
ENFP,"They are charming, ingenuous, risk-taking, sensitive, people-oriented individuals with capabilities ranging across a broad spectrum. They have many gifts which they will use to fulfill themselves and those near them, if they are able to remain centered and master the ability of following through. . Project-oriented. Bright and capable. Warmly, genuinely interested in people; great people skills. Extremely intuitive and perceptive about people. Able to relate to people on their own level. Service-oriented; likely to put the needs of others above their own. Future-oriented. Dislike performing routine tasks. Need approval and appreciation from others. Cooperative and friendly. Creative and energetic. Well-developed verbal and written communication skills. Natural leaders, but do not like to control people. Resist being controlled by others. Can work logically and rationally - use their intuition to understand the goal and work backwards towards it. Usually able to grasp difficult concepts and theories "
ENFP,"They are lucky in that they're good a quite a lot of different things. An XXXX can generally achieve a good degree of success at anything that has interested them. However, They get bored rather easily and are not naturally good at following things through to completion. Accordingly, they should avoid jobs that require performing a lot of detailed, routine-oriented tasks. They will do best in professions that allow them to creatively generate new ideas and deal closely with people. They will not be happy in positions that are confining and regimented.. Consultant. Psychologist. Entrepreneur. Actor. Teacher. Counselor. Politician / Diplomat. Writer / Journalist. Television Reporter. Computer Programmer / Systems Analyst. Scientist. Engineer. Artist"
ENFP,"They take their relationships very seriously, but also approach them with a childlike enthusiasm and energy. They seek and demand authenticity and depth in their personal relationships, and will put forth a lot of effort into making things work out. They are warm, considerate, affirming, nurturing, and highly invested in the health of the relationship. They have excellent interpersonal skills, and are able to inspire and motivate others to be the best that they can be. Energetic and effervescent, the XXXX is sometimes smothering in their enthusiasm, but are generally highly valued for their genuine warmth and high ideals.. Good communication skills. Very perceptive about people's thought and motives. Motivational, inspirational; bring out the best in others. Warmly affectionate and affirming. Fun to be with - lively sense of humor, dramatic, energetic, optimistic. Strive for 'win-win' situations. Driven to meet other's needs. Usually loyal and dedicated . Tendency to be smothering. Their enthusiasm may lead them to be unrealistic. Uninterested in dealing with 'mundane' matters such as cleaning, paying bills, etc.. Hold onto bad relationships long after they've turned bad. Extreme dislike of conflict. Extreme dislike of criticism. Don't pay attention to their own needs. Constant quest for the perfect relationship may make them change relationships frequently. May become bored easily. Have difficulty scolding or punishing others "
ENFP,"They make warm, considerate, passionate partners who are generally willing, eager, and able to do whatever it takes to make The Relationship a positive place to be. They are enthusiastic, idealistic, focused on other people's feelings, and very flexible. These attributes combine to make them especially interested in positive personal relationships, and also makes them very able to promote strong relationships in fun and creative ways. They take their commitments very seriously, and are generally deeply loyal and faithful to their partners."
ENFP,"There are a couple of difficult relationship areas for the XXXX. The first problem is that many They have a problem leaving bad relationships. They tend to internalize any problems and take them on their own shoulders, believing that the success or failure of the relationship is their own responsibility. As perfectionists, they don't like to admit defeat, and will stick with bad situations long after they should have left. When they do leave the relationship, they will believe that the failure was their fault, and that there was surely something they could have done to save the relationship."
ENFP,"On the entirely other end of the spectrum, many They have a difficult time staying focused and following things through to completion. If they have not focused on their ability to follow through, they may have problems staying in dedicated, monogamous relationships. They are so in tune with all of the exciting possibilities of what could be, that they will always fantasize about a greener pasture out there somewhere. If they are not paired with a partner who enjoys new experiences, or who shares their idealistic enthusiasm, the XXXX may become bored. The XXXX who is bored and who is not focused will be very unhappy, and will eventually 'leave' the relationship if the problem is not addressed."
ENFP,"Since relationships are central to the XXXX's life, they will be very 'hands on' and involved with their intimate relationships. They may be in the habit of constantly asking their partner how they're doing, what they're feeling, etc. This behavior may be a bit smothering, but it also supports a strong awareness of the health (or illness) of the relationship."
ENFP,"Sexually, The XXXX is creative, perfectionistic, playful and affectionate. Their rich fantasy world makes them fun and creative lovers, who usually have new ideas up their sleeves. They whole-heartedly embrace the opportunity for closeness with their mates, believing sexual intimacy to be a positive, fun way to express how much you love each other."
ENFP,"The XXXX needs to be given positive assurance and affirmation. More than one XXXX has been known to 'go fishing' for compliments. They like to hear from their significant others that they are loved and valued, and are willing and eager to return the favor. They enjoy lavishing love and affection on their mates, and are creative and energetic in their efforts to please. The XXXX gets a lot of their personal satisfaction from observing the happiness of others, and so is generally determined to please and serve their partners."
ENFP,"problem area for They in relationships is their dislike of conflict and sensitivity to criticism. They are perfectionists who believe that any form of criticism is a stab at their character, which is very difficult for them to take. Conflict situations are sources of extreme stress to the XXXX. They have a tendency to brush issues under the rug rather than confront them head-on, if there is likely to be a conflict. They are also prone to 'give in' easily in conflict situations, just to end the conflict. They might agree to something which goes against their values just to end the uncomfortable situation. In such cases, the problem is extended and will return at a later time. The XXXX needs to realize that conflict situations are not the end of the world. They are entirely normal, and can be quite helpful for the growth of a relationship. They also need to work on taking criticism for what it is, rather than blowing up any negative comment into an indictment against their entire character."
ENFP,"Generally, the XXXX is a warm and affirming creature who is very interested and able to have an intense, meaningful, close relationship with their mate."
ENFP,"They take their parenting role very seriously, but are also very playful. There's a bit of grown-up kid in every XXXX, so they get a lot of fun and enjoyment from playing with their children. However, they consider it essential to pass their strongly-held values and beliefs down to their children, and will strive consistently to create a positive, ideal environment for their children's growth."
ENFP,"The XXXX may exhibit an inconsistency in their roles with their children. At one moment, they might be their child's best friend, laughing and whooping it up, and in the next moment they may appear the stern authoritarian. This inconsistency seems to be a result of a conflict between the XXXX's genuine desire to relate to their children on the children's level, and their compulsion to follow their deeply-felt value system. In other words, the XXXX wants to be their child's friend, but if a value is violated, they will revert to the parental role to make sure their children understand the violation. This inconsistency may be confusing and frustrating for the children."
ENFP,"The children of They generally feel loved, because the XXXX gives their children plenty of genuine warmth and support. They usually value their children as individuals, allowing them room for growth. The XXXX's enthusiasm and affection may at times seem smothering to their children. This will be especially true for children with strong Thinking or Sensing preferences, who will have a difficult time understanding the effervescence of the XXXX, and will feel at times embarassed by the XXXX's enthusiasm and tendency to display their affection publicly."
ENFP,"The XXXX is able to take care of day-to-day necessities, such as picking children up at the correct times, getting them to softball practice, getting them fed, etc. However, it is a chore for the XXXX and is not a natural strength. The XXXX also has a difficult time disciplining their children, unless a very strongly-held value has been violated."
ENFP,"The rich imagination and creativity of the XXXX parent creates a fun, dynamic and exciting environment for kids. The XXXX's strong value system turns experiences into meaningful lessons for their children. The XXXX parent is valued by their children for their warm, affirming natures, and their fun-loving approach to living."
ENFP,"They are warm and sociable people who are keenly in tune with other people's feelings and perspectives. They are energetic and fun to be with. They are very affirming, and get great satisfaction from supporting and lifting up others. They are idealists who seek authenticity in their personal relationships. They are valued by their peers and confidantes as warm, supportive, giving people."
ENFP,"In the workplace or other casual relationship environments, the XXXX is likely to get along well with almost all other types of people. They are genuinely interested in people, and are highly perceptive about them, to the point where they're able to understand and relate to all of the personality types with relative ease. They like to see the best in others, and are likely to bring out the best in others. While they are generally accepting of most all people, They with strong Feeling preferences may have a difficult time understanding people with very strong Thinking preferences who do not respond to the XXXX's enthusiastic warmth. The XXXX will stay open-minded about what they consider a 'rejection' by the Thinker, until the situation has repeated itself a few times, in which case the XXXX may shut themselves entirely against the Thinker."
ENFP,"They may also feel threatened by individuals with strong Judging preferences. With a tendency to take any criticism personally, the XXXX may find themselves irritated or emotional when the Judger expresses a negative opinion, believing somehow that the Judger is expressing disapproval or disappointment in the XXXX."
ENFP,"For close friendships, They are especially drawn to other iNtuitive Feeling types, and to other Extraverts who are also enthusiastic about life. Like the other iNtuitive Feeling types, the XXXX needs authenticity and depth in their close relationships. They're likely to have friends from all walks of life who they feel close to and care about, but will have only a few very close friends with similar ideals to their own. The XXXX also tends to value the company of iNtuitive Thinkers."
ENFP,"They are motivated in everything that they do by a desire to understand the world around them. They are constantly searching about, mentally and physically, for input that will help them to better understand the Big Picture. They are open-minded to new people and new experiences; they're eager for the opportunity to understand what the new people and experiences are all about. They use their understanding of the world to serve the agendas of their value systems. An XXXX's value system often includes respect for the needs and desires of individual people over the needs of a social group. Their respect for the individual makes them dislike controlling others, and being controlled by others. They are passionate about their beliefs, whatever they may be. They often stubbornly adhere to their value system regardless of threats to its validity. They are more concerned with keeping true to what they believe than they are with expectations or demands from the social group that they function within. They dislike personal criticism, because it threatens their validity as an individual and the validity of their value system. They may internalize anger rather than express it; their respect for other individuals makes it difficult for them to hurt others. An XXXX's feeling of success depends upon the availability of opportunities to grow their understanding of the world, upon feeling that they're living true to their personal value system, and upon the condition of their closest relationships."
ENFP,"They're exceptionally perceptive about people and situations. The're often able to quickly and accurately assess where someone is coming from. They accept and value people as individuals, and are strongly egalitarian. They believe that individuals have the right to be themselves, and are very tolerant and accepting of most people. They're often deep and intelligent, and may be quite brilliant in their ability to tie things together. They're wired to look for connections int the external world, and so may mentally put things together more easily than many. Their interest in understanding the world usually makes them in tune with what's socially acceoptable and what isn't. This may help them to be popular and likable. They're highly creative. This ability may be used in an artistic way, or way to be used to generate ideas and new ways of thinking."
ENFP,"They will have the ability to follow through on projects they've begun. They will be less gullible and malleable, and generally more able to discern between 'good' and 'bad', rather than accepting everything without question. They may be highly artistic. They will have the ability to focus and concentrate deeply on tasks. This enhanced ability to think and process information internally will make them more capable on many levels. They will balance out their desire to meet new people and have new experiences with the desire to put their understand to use in some way. They will find more meaning and purpose in their lives."
ENFP,"May be what many would call a 'sucker' - vulnerable to schemers and con artists. May get themselves into dangerous situations because they are too eager to push the envelope of their understanding, and not willing to apply judgment to anything. May feel intense anger towards people who criticise them or try to control them, but will be unable to express the anger. Left unexpressed, the anger may fester, simmer, and become destructive. May blame their problems on other people, using logic and ration to defend themselves against the world. May develop strong negative judgments that are difficut to unseat against people who they perceive have been oppressive to them. May get involved with drugs, alcohol, or promiscuity, and generally seek mindless experiences and sensations. May skip from relationship to relationship without the ability to commit. May start projects but be unable to finish them. May be unable to keep a job for any length of time."
ENFP,"Nearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be attributed in various degrees to the common XXXX problem of wanting to understand and experience everything at any cost. If the XXXX does not learn how to discriminate things and people in their external environment, the XXXX will begin to use their judging function (Xx) as a 'rubber stamper' to support their agenda to seek out experiences. This is a natural survivalistic technique for the XXXX personality. The main driver to the XXXX personality is Xx, whose purpose is to understand the world as one Big Picture, seeking connections and meaning in everything. If their ability to seek understanding is threatened, the XXXX shuts out the threatening force. This is totally natural, but unfortunately the individual who exercises this type of agenda protection regularly will become more and more unable to apply objective judgment to anything. When the unbalanced XXXX does apply judgement, it will generally be skewed to support their subjective agenda. They will always find justification for their own inappropriate behaviour. They will be unable to finish anything that they start, and generally wander through life from experience to experience."
ENFP,"It's very common for They to resist applying judgement until they feel they truly understand a person or situation. However, part of the understanding process includes using discernment to classify qualities. If the XXXX shuts judgment off entirely, he or she will not achieve their ultimate goal of understanding; rather they will jump from experience to experience in a purposeless fashion."
ENFP,"Anger can be a problem for anybody, but may be especially so for They who have not sufficiently developed their Xx. The desire to keep everything non-judgmental, combined with the tendency to use Xx as justification rather than true judgement is a recipe for suppressed anger. These are very contradictory forces. 'I hate you for judging me' is an ironic feeling, but is unfortunately common. The inability to apply judgment, or to accept negative judgment, makes it difficult for the XXXX to express anger, as anger often comes with negative judgment in tow. Therefore, the XXXX stews in their anger, rather than dealing with it."
ENFP,"To grow as an individual, the XXXX needs to focus on applying judgement to all of their perceptions. This means they need to decide how they really feel about people, places and things, rather than allowing their feelings to hang open indeterminately. The XXXX needs to understand that developing their ability to discern qualities does not threaten their ability to understand the world, but rather enhances it, and enhances their personal changes for achieving a measure of success in their lives."
ENFP,"The XXXX concerned with personal growth will pay close attention to their motivation for making a judgment. Are they trying to really determine the objective value or merit of something, or are they trying to defend their individual right to not be judged or controlled? The goal when judging something is to not let your life experiences cloud your opinions. Obviously, this is not entirely possible, but it is the exercise to keep in mind. You want to open your mind to judgment without feeling threatened, and without using your own judgement in a defensive, rationalizing mode."
ENFP,"As can be seen from the above, some They can have difficulty fitting into society. Their problems are often due top feeling different from others because of their dominant Intuition, and being unable to stick to anything long enough to feel a sense of accomplishment. They feel like they don't fit in, and can't find the place where they belong in the world. The XXXX who consistently makes decisions and applies classifications to their ideas will be able to turn their ideas into reality, and experience the feelings of accomplishment and success that accompany being effective."
INFP,"As an XXXX, your primary mode of living is focused internally, where you deal with things according to how you feel about them, or how they fit into your personal value system. Your secondary mode is external, where you take things in primarily via your intuition."
INFP,"They, more than other iNtuitive Feeling types, are focused on making the world a better place for people. Their primary goal is to find out their meaning in life. What is their purpose? How can they best serve humanity in their lives? They are idealists and perfectionists, who drive themselves hard in their quest for achieving the goals they have identified for themselves"
INFP,"They are highly intuitive about people. They rely heavily on their intuitions to guide them, and use their discoveries to constantly search for value in life. They are on a continuous mission to find the truth and meaning underlying things. Every encounter and every piece of knowledge gained gets sifted through the XXXX's value system, and is evaluated to see if it has any potential to help the XXXX define or refine their own path in life. The goal at the end of the path is always the same - the XXXX is driven to help people and make the world a better place."
INFP,"Generally thoughtful and considerate, They are good listeners and put people at ease. Although they may be reserved in expressing emotion, they have a very deep well of caring and are genuinely interested in understanding people. This sincerity is sensed by others, making the XXXX a valued friend and confidante. An XXXX can be quite warm with people he or she knows well."
INFP,"They do not like conflict, and go to great lengths to avoid it. If they must face it, they will always approach it from the perspective of their feelings. In conflict situations, They place little importance on who is right and who is wrong. They focus on the way that the conflict makes them feel, and indeed don't really care whether or not they're right. They don't want to feel badly. This trait sometimes makes them appear irrational and illogical in conflict situations. On the other hand, They make very good mediators, and are typically good at solving other people's conflicts, because they intuitively understand people's perspectives and feelings, and genuinely want to help them."
INFP,"They are flexible and laid-back, until one of their values is violated. In the face of their value system being threatened, They can become aggressive defenders, fighting passionately for their cause. When an XXXX has adopted a project or job which they're interested in, it usually becomes a 'cause' for them. Although they are not detail-oriented individuals, they will cover every possible detail with determination and vigor when working for their 'cause'."
INFP,"When it comes to the mundane details of life maintenance, They are typically completely unaware of such things. They might go for long periods without noticing a stain on the carpet, but carefully and meticulously brush a speck of dust off of their project booklet."
INFP,"They do not like to deal with hard facts and logic. Their focus on their feelings and the Human Condition makes it difficult for them to deal with impersonal judgment. They don't understand or believe in the validity of impersonal judgment, which makes them naturally rather ineffective at using it. Most They will avoid impersonal analysis, although some have developed this ability and are able to be quite logical. Under stress, it's not uncommon for They to mis-use hard logic in the heat of anger, throwing out fact after (often inaccurate) fact in an emotional outburst."
INFP,"They have very high standards and are perfectionists. Consequently, they are usually hard on themselves, and don't give themselves enough credit. They may have problems working on a project in a group, because their standards are likely to be higher than other members' of the group. In group situations, they may have a 'control' problem. The XXXX needs to work on balancing their high ideals with the requirements of every day living. Without resolving this conflict, they will never be happy with themselves, and they may become confused and paralyzed about what to do with their lives."
INFP,"They are usually talented writers. They may be awkard and uncomfortable with expressing themselves verbally, but have a wonderful ability to define and express what they're feeling on paper. They also appear frequently in social service professions, such as counselling or teaching. They are at their best in situations where they're working towards the public good, and in which they don't need to use hard logic."
INFP,"They who function in their well-developed sides can accomplish great and wonderful things, which they will rarely give themselves credit for. Some of the great, humanistic catalysts in the world have been They. . Strong value systems. Warmly interested in people. Service-oriented, usually putting the needs of others above their own. Loyal and devoted to people and causes. Future-oriented. Growth-oriented; always want to be growing in a positive direction. Creative and inspirational. Flexible and laid-back, unless a ruling principle is violated. Sensitive and complex. Dislike dealing with details and routine work. Original and individualistic - 'out of the mainstream'. Excellent written communication skills. Prefer to work alone, and may have problems working on teams. Value deep and authentic relationships. Want to be seen and appreciated for who they are "
INFP,"The XXXX is a special, sensitive individual who needs a career that is more than a job. The XXXX needs to feel that everything they do in their lives is in accordance with their strongly-felt value systems, and is moving them and/or others in a positive, growth-oriented direction. They are driven to do something meaningful and purposeful with their lives. The XXXX will be happiest in careers that allow them to live their daily lives in accordance with their values, and that work towards the greater good of humanity. It's worth mentioning that nearly all of the truly great writers in the world have been They."
INFP,"Writers Counselors / Social Workers Teachers / Professors Psychologists Psychiatrists Musicians Clergy / Religious Workers"
INFP,"They present a calm, pleasant face to the world. They appear to be tranquil and peaceful to others, with simple desires. In fact, the XXXX internally feels his or her life intensely. In the relationship arena, this causes them to have a very deep capacity for love and caring which is not frequently found with such intensity in the other types. They do not share their intensity of feeling with anyone; they tend to be reserved about expressing their inner-most feelings, and reserve their deepest love and caring for a select few. They are generally laid-back, supportive and nurturing in their close relationships. With Xx dominating their personality, they're very sensitive and in-tune with people's feelings, and feel genuine concern and caring for others. Slow to trust others and cautious in the beginning of a relationship, an XXXX will be fiercely loyal once they are committed. With their strong inner core of values, they are intense individuals who value depth and authenticity in their relationships, and hold those who understand and accept the XXXX's perspectives in especially high regard. They are usually adaptable and congenial, unless one of their ruling principles has been violated, in which case they stop adapting and become staunch defenders of their values. They will be uncharacteristically harsh and rigid in such a situation.. Warmly concerned and caring towards others. Sensitive and perceptive about what others are feeling. Loyal and committed - they want lifelong relationships. Deep capacity for love and caring. Driven to meet other's needs. Strive for 'win-win' situations. Nurturing, supportive and encouraging. Likely to recognize and appreciate other's need for space. Able to express themselves well. Flexible and diverse. May tend to be shy and reserved. Don't like to have their 'space' invaded. Extreme dislike of conflict. Extreme dislike of criticism. Strong need to receive praise and positive affirmation. May react very emotionally to stressful situations. Have difficulty leaving a bad relationship. Have difficulty scolding or punishing others. Tend to be reserved about expressing their feelings. Perfectionistic tendancies may cause them to not give themselves enough credit. Tendency to blame themselves for problems, and hold everything on their own shoulders "
INFP,"They feel tremendous loyalty and commitment to their relationships. With the Feeling preference dominating their personality, harmony and warm feelings are central to the XXXX's being. They feel a need to be in a committed, loving relationship. If they are not involved in such a relationship, the XXXX will be either actively searching for one, or creating one in their own minds."
INFP,"They' tendency to be idealistic and romantically-minded may cause them to fantasize frequently about a 'more perfect' relationship or situation. They may also romanticize their mates into having qualities which they do not actually possess. Most They have a problem with reconciling their highly idealistic and romantic views of life with the reality of their own lives, and so they are constantly somewhat unsettled with themselves and with their close personal relationships. However, the XXXX's deeply-felt, sincere love for their mates and their intense dislike of conflict keeps the XXXX loyal to their relationships, in spite of their troubles achieving peace of mind."
INFP,"Unlike other types who tend to hold their mates up on a pedastal, the XXXX's tendency to do so does not really turn into a negative thing in the relationship. They hold tightly to their ideals, and work hard at constantly seeing their mates up on that pedastal. The frequent XXXX result is a strongly affirming, proud and affectionate attitude towards their mates which stands the test of time."
INFP,"They are not naturally interested in administrative matters such as bill-paying and house-cleaning, but they can be very good at performing these tasks when they must. They can be really good money managers when they apply themselves."
INFP,"Sexually, the XXXX is likely to be initially slow to open up to their mates. Once their trust has been earned, the XXXX will view sexual intimacy as an opportunity for expressing their deep-seated love and affection. More than the actual sexual act, they will value giving and receiving love and sweet words. With their tendency to enjoy serving others, they may value their mates satisfaction above their own."
INFP,"One real problem area for the XXXX is their intensive dislike of conflict and criticism. The XXXX is quick to find a personal angle in any critical comment, whether or not anything personal was intended. They will tend to take any sort of criticism as a personal attack on their character, and will usually become irrational and emotional in such situations. This can be a real problem for They who are involved with persons who have Thinking and Judging preferences. 'TJ's relate to others with a objective, decisive attitude that frequently shows an opinion on the topic of conversation. If the opinion is negative, the TJ's attitude may be threatening to the XXXX, who will tend to respond emotionally to the negativity and be vaguely but emphatically convinced that the negativity is somehow the XXXX's fault."
INFP,"For They with extremely dominant Feeling preferences who have not developed their Intuitive sides sufficiently to gather good data for their decision making processes, their dislike of conflict and criticism can foretell doom and gloom for intimate relationships. These They will react with extreme emotional distress to conflict situations, and will not know what to do about it. Since they will have no basis for determining what action to take, they will do whatever they can to get rid of the conflict - which frequently means lashing out irrationally at others, or using guilt manipulation to get their mates to give them the positive support that they crave. This kind of behavior does not bode well for healthy, long-term relationships. Individuals who recognize this tendency in themselves should work on their ability to take criticism objectively rather than personally. They should also try to remember that conflict situations are not always their fault, and they're definitely not the end of the world. Conflict is a fact of life, and facing it and addressing it immediately avoids having to deal with it in the future, after it has become a much larger problem."
INFP,"They are very aware of their own space, and the space of others. They value their personal space, and the freedom to do their own thing. They will cherish the mate who sees the XXXX for who they are, and respects their unique style and perspectives. The XXXX is not likely to be overly jealous or possessive, and is likely to respect their mate's privacy and independence. In fact, the XXXX is likely to not only respect their mate's perspectives and goals, but to support them with loyal firmness."
INFP,"In general, They are warmly affirming and loving partners who make the health of their relationships central in their lives. Although cautious in the beginning, they become firmly loyal to their committed relationships, which are likely to last a lifetime. They take their relationships very seriously, and will put forth a great deal of effort into making them work."
INFP,"They are 'natural' parents. They accept and enjoy the parental role, seeing it as the natural extension of their value systems. They make use of the parental role for developing and defining their values further, and consider it their task to pass their values on to their children. They take their role quite seriously. Warm, affirming, and flexible, the XXXX generally makes a gentle and easy-going parent in many respects."
INFP,"They do not like conflict situations, and will keep themselves flexible and diverse to promote a positive, conflict-free environment in their home. The XXXX is not naturally prone to dole out punishment or discipline, and so is likely to adapt to their mate's disciplinary policy, or to rely on their mates to administer discipline with the children. In the absence of a mating parent, the XXXX will need to make a conscious effort of creating a structure for their children to live within."
INFP,"Although the XXXX dislikes punishing others, they hold strong values and will not tolerate the violation of a strongly-held belief. If they feel that their child has truly committed a wrong, the XXXX parent will not have a problem administering discipline. They will directly confront the child, stubbornly digging in their heels and demanding recourse."
INFP,"The XXXX parent is likely to value their children as individuals, and to give them room for growth. They will let the children have their own voice and place in the family."
INFP,"Extremely loving and devoted parents, They will fiercely protect and support their children. If there is an issue involving 'taking sides', you can bet the XXXX will always be loyal to their children."
INFP,"They are usually remembered by their children as loving, patient, devoted, and flexible parents."
INFP,"They are warm and caring individuals who highly value authenticity and depth in their personal relationships. They are usually quite perceptive about other people's feelings and motives, and are consequently able to get along with all sorts of different people. However, the XXXX will keep their true selves reserved from others except for a select few, with whom they will form close and lasting friendships. With their high ideals, they are likely to be drawn to other iNtuitive Feelers for their closer friendships."
INFP,"With their strong need for harmony and dislike of conflict, They may feel threatened by people with strong Judging and Thinking preferences. Although they're likely to be able to work well professionally with such individuals, they may have difficulty accepting or appreciating them on a personal level. They generally feel a kinship and affinity with other Feeling types."
INFP,"They will be valued by their confidantes as genuine, altruistic, deep, caring, original individuals."
INFP,"They are creative, sensitive souls who take their lives very seriously. They seek harmony and authenticity in their relationships with others. They value creativity, spirituality, and honoring the individual self above all else. They are very tuned into inequity and unfairness against people, and get great satisfaction from conquering such injustices. An XXXX is a perfectionist who will rarely allow themselves to feel successful, although they will be keenly aware of failures. They also get satisfaction from being in touch with their creativity. For the XXXX, personal success depends upon the condition of their closest relationships, the development of their creative abilities, and the continual support of humanity by serving people in need, fighting against injustice, or in some other way working to make the world a better place to be."
INFP,"Highly creative, artistic and spiritual, they can produce wonderful works of art, music and literature. They are natural artists. They will find great satisfaction if they encourage and develop their artistic abilities. That doesn't mean that an XXXX has to be a famous writer or painter in order to be content. Simply the act of 'creating' will be a fulfilling source of renewal and refreshment to the XXXX. An XXXX should allow himself or herself some artistic outlet, because it will add enrichment and positive energy to their life."
INFP,"They're more spiritually aware than most people, and are more in touch with their soul than others. Most They have strong Faith. Those that don't may feel as if they're missing something important. An XXXX should nourish their faith."
INFP,"They are very aware of social injustice, and empathize with the underdog. Their empathy for the underdog and hyper-awareness of social injustice makes them extremely compassionate and nurturing towards disadvantaged members of our society. They will feel most useful and fulfilled when they are fighting to help people who have been misfortunate in our society. They may be teachers, ministers, writers, counsellors or psychologists, but they will most likely all spend extra time trying to help people with special problems. An XXXX can find a tremendous amount of satisfaction by enacting some kind of social change that will help the underdog."
INFP,"They're usually good listeners who genuinely want to hear about someone's problems, and genuinely want to help them. This makes them outstanding counsellors, and good friends. An XXXX may find great satisfaction from volunteering as a counselor."
INFP,"They accept and value people as individuals, and are strongly egalitarian. They believe that an individual has the right to be themself, without having their attitudes and perspectives brought under scrutiny. Accordingly, they have a great deal of tolerance and acceptance dealing with people who might encounter negative judgment from society in general. They can see something positive in everyone. They believe in individuals. If they give themselves the opportunity, an XXXX can become a much-needed source of self-esteem and confidence for people who cannot find it on their own. In this way, they can nurture a 'sick soul' back to health."
INFP,"Usually deep and intelligent, they're able to grasp difficult concepts with relative ease. They usually do quite well academically, and will find that educating their minds nourishes their need to think deeply."
INFP,"They will have a great deal of insight into people's characters. They will quickly and thoroughly understand where a person is coming from by assessing their motives and feelings. These well-developed XXXX individuals make outstanding psychologists (such as Isabel Briggs Myers herself) and counselors. They might also be great fiction writers, because they're able to develop very complex, real characters."
INFP,"They will quickly understand different situations, and quickly grasp new concepts. They will find that they're able to do anything that they put their mind to, although they may not find it personally satisfying. Things may seem to come easily to these They. Although they're able to conquer many different kinds of tasks and situations, these They will be happiest doing something that seems truly important to them. Although they may find that they can achieve the 'mainstream' type of success with relative ease, they are not likely to find happiness along that path, unless they are living their lives with authenticity and depth."
INFP,"The XXXX who augments their strong, internal value system (Xx) with a well-developed intuitive way of perceiving the world (Xx) can be a powerful force for social change. Their intense values and strong empathy for the underprivileged, combined with a reliable and deeply insightful understanding of the world that we live in, creates an individual with the power to make a difference (such as Mother Teresa - an XXXX)."
INFP,"They are rare, intelligent, creative beings with many special gifts. I would like for the XXXX to keep in mind some of the many positive things associated with being an XXXX as they read some of this more negative material. Also remember that the weaknesses associated with being an XXXX are natural to your type. Although it may be depressing to read about your type's weaknesses, please remember that we offer this information to enact positive change. We want people to grow into their own potential, and to live happy and successful lives."
INFP,"May be extremely sensitive to any kind of criticism May perceive criticism where none was intended May have skewed or unrealistic ideas about reality May be unable to acknowledge or hear anything that goes against their personal ideas and opinions May blame their problems on other people, seeing themselves as victims who are treated unfairly May have great anger, and show this anger with rash outpourings of bad temper May be unaware of appropriate social behavior May be oblivious to their personal appearance, or to appropriate dress May come across as eccentric, or perhaps even generally strange to others, without being aware of it May be unable to see or understand anyone else's point of view May value their own opinions and feelings far above others May be unaware of how their behavior affects others May be oblivious to other people's need May feel overwhelmed with tension and stress when someone expresses disagreement with the XXXX, or disapproval of the XXXX May develop strong judgments that are difficult to unseed against people who they perceive have been oppressive or suppressive to them Under great stress, may obsess about details that are unimportant to the big picture of things Under stress, may obsessively brood over a problem repeatedly May have unreasonable expectations of others May have difficulty maintaining close relationships, due to unreasonable expectations"
INFP,"Nearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be attributed in various degrees to the common XXXX problem of only taking in data that justifies their personal opinions. They are usually very intense and sensitive people, and feel seriously threatened by criticism. They are likely to treat any point of view other than their own as criticism of their own perspective. If the XXXX does not learn how to deal with this perceived criticism, the XXXX will begin to shut out the incoming information that causes them pain. This is a natural survivalistic technique for the XXXX personality. The main driver to the XXXX personality is Xx, whose purpose is to maintain and honor an intensely personal system of values and morals. If an XXXX's personal value system is threatened by external influences, the XXXX shuts out the threatening data in order to preserve and honor their value system. This is totally natural, and works well to protect the individual psyche from getting hurt. However, the XXXX who exercises this type of self-protection regularly will become more and more unaware of other people's perspectives, and thus more and more isolated from a real understanding of the world that they live in. They will always find justification for their own inappropriate behaviors, and will always find fault with the external world for problems that they have in their lives. It will be difficult for them to maintain close personal relationships because they will have unreasonable expectations, and will be unable to accept blame."
INFP,"Its not an uncommon tendency for the XXXX to look to the external world primarily for information that will support their ideas and values. However, if this tendency is given free reign, the resulting XXXX personality is too self-centered to be happy or successful. Since the XXXX's dominant function to their personality is Xx, they must balance this with an auxiliary Extraverted iNtuitive function. The XXXX takes in information via Xx. This is also the XXXX's primary way of dealing with the external world. If the XXXX uses Xx only to serve the purposes of Xx, then the XXXX is not using Extraversion effectively at all. As a result, the XXXX does not take in enough information about the external world to have a good sense of what's going on. They see nothing but their own perspective, and deal with the world only so far as they need to in order to support their perspective. These individuals usually come across as selfish and unrealistic. Depending on how serious the problem is, they may appear to be anything from 'a bit eccentric' to 'way out there'. Many times other people are unable to understand or relate to these people."
INFP,"To grow as an individual, the XXXX needs to focus on opening their perspective to include a more accurate picture of what is really going on in the world. In order to be in a position in which the XXXX is able to perceive and consider data that is foreign to their internal value system, the XXXX needs to know that its value system is not threatened by the new information. The XXXX must consciously tell himself/herself that an opinion that does not concede with their own is not an indictment of their entire character."
INFP,"The XXXX who is concerned with personal growth will pay close attention to their motivation for taking in information. Do they take in information to better understand a situation or concept? Or, do they take in information to support a personal idea or cause? At the moment when something is perceived, is the XXXX concerned with twisting that perception to fit in with their personal values? Or is she/he concerned with absorbing the information objectively? To achieve a better understanding of the external world, the XXXX should try to perceive information objectively, before fitting it into their value system. They should consciously be aware of their tendency to discard anything that doesn't agree with their values, and work towards lessening this tendency. They should try to see situations from other people's perspectives, without making personal judgments about the situations or the other people's perspectives. In general, they should work on exercising their iNtuition in a truly Extraverted sense. In other words, they should use iNtuition to take in information about the world around them for the sake of understanding the world, rather than take in information to support their own conclusions. The XXXX who successfully perceives things objectively may be quite a powerful force for positive change."
INFP,"Some They have difficulty fitting into our society. Their problems are often a result of an unawareness of appropriate social behavior, an unawareness of how they come across to others, or unrealistic expectations of others. Any one of these three issues stem from using Xx in a diminished manner. An XXXX who takes in information for the sake of understanding the world around them, rather than one who takes in information only to support their own ideas, will have a clearer, more objective understanding of how society values social behaviors and attitudes. He or she will also be more aware of how they are perceived by others, and will have more realistic expectations for others' behavior within a relationship. Such well-adjusted They will fit happily into our society."
ESTJ,"They are highly social and community-minded, with many rising to positions of responsibility in their school, church, industry, or civic groups. They are generous with their time and energy, and very often belong to a variety of service clubs, lodges, and associations, supporting them through steady attendance, but also taking an outspoken leadership role. They like to take charge of groups and are comfortable issuing orders. They are cooperative with their own superiors, and they would like cooperation from the people working under them. Rank, they believe, has its obligations, but it also has its privileges."
ESTJ,"Comprising at least ten percent of the population, They enjoy and are good at making schedules, agendas, inventories, and so on, and they much prefer tried and true ways of doing things over speculation and experimentation. They keep their feet firmly on the ground and would like those under their supervision to do the same, whether employee, subordinate, spouse, or offspring. They have no problem evaluating others and tend to judge how a person is doing in terms of his or her compliance with, and respect for, schedules and procedures."
ESTJ,"They are unbelievably hard-working. Even as children they are industrious, and they usually respect their parents as authority figures. In school They are often model students, dutifully following directions, doing all their homework, doing it thoroughly, and on time. Above all else, they wish to do what they are supposed to do, and they rarely question the teacher’s assignments, method of instruction, standards, or authority. And their industry and perseverance only become more important to them as they grow into adulthood and take on the responsibilities of job and family."
ESTJ,"They approach human relations along traditional lines. Marriage and parenthood are sacred to them, and they tend to have a large circle of friends, with many friendships faithfully maintained over the years. Social gatherings and ceremonies have great meaning for them, and they look forward to holiday parties, club dances, weddings, class reunions, awards banquets, and the like. In social situations, They are friendly and talk easily with others. Though they can seem a bit formal in their manners, They are pretty easy to get to know. At ease in polite company, they tend not to confuse people by sending double messages or putting on airs-what they seem to be, they are."
ISTJ,"The one word that best describes They is superdependable. Whether at home or at work, They are extraordinarily persevering and dutiful, particularly when it comes to keeping an eye on the people and products they are responsible for. In their quiet way, They see to it that rules are followed, laws are respected, and standards are upheld."
ISTJ,"They (as much as ten percent of the general population) are the true guardians of institutions. They are patient with their work and with the procedures within an institution, although not always with the unauthorized behavior of some people in that institution. Responsible to the core, They like it when people know their duties, follow the guidelines, and operate within the rules. For their part, They will see to it that goods are examined and schedules are kept, that resources will be up to standards and delivered when and where they are supposed to be. And they would prefer that everyone be this dependable. They can be hard-nosed about the need for following the rules in the workplace, and do not hesitate to report irregularities to the proper authorities. Because of this they are often misjudged as being hard-hearted, or as having ice in their veins, for people fail to see their good intentions and their vulnerability to criticism. Also, because They usually make their inspections without much flourish or fanfare, the dedication they bring to their work can go unnoticed and unappreciated."
ISTJ,"While not as talkative as XXXX Guardians [They], They are still highly sociable, and are likely to be involved in community service organizations, such as Sunday School, Little League, or Boy and Girl Scouting, that transmit traditional values to the young. Like all Guardians, They hold dear their family social ceremonies-weddings, birthdays, and anniversaries – although they tend to be shy if the occasion becomes too large or too public. Generally speaking, They are not comfortable with anything that gets too fancy. Their words tend to be plain and down-to-earth, not showy or high-flown; their clothes are often simple and conservative rather than of the latest fashion; and their home and work environments are usually neat, orderly, and traditional, rather than trendy or ostentatious. As for personal property, they usually choose standard items over models loaded with features, and they often try to find classics and antiques – They prefer the old-fashioned to the newfangled every time."
ESFJ,"They take it upon themselves to insure the health and welfare of those in their care, but they are also the most sociable of all the Guardians, and thus are the great nurturers of social institutions such as schools, churches, social clubs, and civic groups. They are very likely more than ten percent of the population, and this is fortunate for the rest of us, because friendly social service is a key to their nature. Wherever they go, They happily give their time and energy to make sure that the needs of others are met, and that social functions are a success."
ESFJ,"Highly cooperative themselves, They are skilled in maintaining teamwork among their helpers, and are also tireless in their attention to the details of furnishing goods and services. They make excellent chairpersons in charge of dances, banquets, class reunions, charity fund-raisers, and the like. They are without peer as masters of ceremonies, able to speak publicly with ease and confidence. And they are outstanding hosts or hostesses, knowing everyone by name, and seemingly aware of what everyone’s been doing. They love to entertain, and are always concerned about the needs of their guests, wanting to make sure that all are involved and provided for."
ESFJ,"Friendly, outgoing, neighborly – in a word, They are gregarious, so much so that they can become restless when isolated from people. They love to talk with others, and will often strike up a conversation with strangers and chat pleasantly about any topic that comes to mind. Friendships matter a great deal to They, and their conversations with friends often touch on good times from years past. Family traditions are also sacred to them, and they carefully observe birthdays and anniversaries. In addition, They show a delightful fascination with news of their friends and neighbors. If we wish to know what’s been going on in the local community, school, or church, they’re happy to fill us in on all the details."
ESFJ,"They are extremely sensitive to the feelings of others, which makes them perhaps the most sympathetic of all the types, but which also leaves them somewhat self-conscious, that is, highly sensitive to what others think of them. Loving and affectionate themselves, they need to be loved in return. In fact, They can be crushed by personal criticism, and are happiest when given ample appreciation both for themselves personally and for the tireless service they give to others."
ISFJ,"We are lucky that Protectors make up as much as ten percent the population, because their primary interest is in the safety and security of those they care about – their family, their circle of friends, their students, their patients, their boss, their fellow-workers, or their employees. Protectors have an extraordinary sense of loyalty and responsibility in their makeup, and seem fulfilled in the degree they can shield others from the dirt and dangers of the world. Speculating and experimenting do not intrigue Protectors, who prefer to make do with time-honored and time-tested products and procedures rather than change to new. At work Protectors are seldom happy in situations where the rules are constantly changing, or where long-established ways of doing things are not respected. For their part, Protectors value tradition, both in the culture and in their family. Protectors believe deeply in the stability of social ranking conferred by birth, titles, offices, and credentials. And they cherish family history and enjoy caring for family property, from houses to heirlooms."
ISFJ,"Wanting to be of service to others, Protectors find great satisfaction in assisting the downtrodden, and can deal with disability and neediness in others better than any other type. They are not as outgoing and talkative as the XXXX Guardians [They], and their shyness is often misjudged as stiffness, even coldness, when in truth Protectors are warm-hearted and sympathetic, giving happily of themselves to those in need."
ISFJ,"Their reserve ought really to be seen as an expression of their sincerity and seriousness of purpose. The most diligent of all the types, Protectors are willing to work long, hard hours quietly doing all the thankless jobs that others manage to avoid. Protectors are quite happy working alone; in fact, in positions of authority they may try to do everything themselves rather than direct others to get the job done. Thoroughness and frugality are also virtues for them. When Protectors undertake a task, they will complete it if humanly possible. They also know better than any other type the value of a dollar, and they abhor the squandering or misuse of money. To save, to put something aside against an unpredictable future, to prepare for emergencies-these are actions near and dear to the Protector’s heart. For all these reasons, Protectors are frequently overworked, just as they are frequently misunderstood and undervalued. Their contributions, and also their economies, are often taken for granted, and they rarely get the gratitude they deserve."
ESTP,"There are lots of They — maybe ten or so percent of the population, and life is never dull around them. In a word, they are men and women of action. When a XXXX is present, things begin to happen: the lights come on, the music plays, the games begin. Clever and full of fun, They live with a theatrical flourish which makes even the most routine events seem exciting. Not that they waste much time on routine events. In work and in play, They demand new activities and new challenges. Bold and daring at heart, and ever-optimistic that things will go their way, They will take tremendous risks to get what they want, and seem exhilarated by walking close to the edge of disaster. Because of this, they make the very best trouble-spot administrators and negotiators, and they can be outstanding entrepreneurs, able to swing deals and kick-start enterprises in a way no other type can."
ESTP,"They also have a hearty appetite for the finer things of life, the best food, the best wine, expensive cars, and fashionable clothes. And they are extremely sophisticated in social circles, knowing many, many people by name, and knowing how to say just the right thing to most everyone they meet."
ESTP,"Charming, confident, and popular, They delight their friends and investors with their endless supply of stories and jokes. At the same time, these smooth operators are usually something of a mystery to others. While they live in the moment and lend excitement – and unpredictability – to all their relationships, they rarely let anyone get really close to them. They have a low tolerance for authority and commitment, and are likely to leave situations where they are expected to toe the mark, or where they must play second fiddle. They understand well the maxim, “He who travels fastest, travels alone,” although they are not likely to be lonely for long, since their boldness and sense of adventure tends to make them highly attractive to many other people."
ISTP,"The nature of They is most clearly seen in their masterful operation of tools, equipment, machines, and instruments of all kinds. Most us use tools in some capacity, of course, but They (as much as ten percent of the population) are the true masters of tool work, with an innate ability to command tools and to become expert at all the crafts requiring tool skills. Even from an early age they are drawn to tools as if to a magnet — tools fall into their hands demanding use, and they must work with them."
ISTP,"Like all the Artisans, They are people who love action, and who know instinctively that their activities are more enjoyable, and more effective, if done impulsively, spontaneously, subject to no schedules or standards but their own. In a sense, They do not work with their tools, but play with them when the urge strikes them. They also seek fun and games on impulse, looking for any opportunity, and just because they feel like it, to play with their various toys: cars, motorcycles, boats, dune-buggies, hunting rifles, fishing tackle, scuba gear, and on and on. They thrive on excitement, particularly the rush of speed-racing, water-skiing, surfing. And They are fearless in their play, exposing themselves to danger again and again, even despite frequent injury. Of all the types, They are most likely to be risk takers, pitting themselves, or their technique, against chance or odds."
ISTP,"Perhaps this is because they tend to communicate through action, and show little interest in developing language skills. Their lack of expressiveness can isolate them at school and on the job, and even though they hang around with their own kind in play, they let their actions speak for them, and their actual conversation is sparse and brief."
ISTP,"They can be wonderfully generous and loyal to their friends, teammates, and sidekicks, often giving up their evenings or weekends to help with building projects or mechanical repairs-house remodeling, for example, or working on cars or boats. On the other hand, they can be fiercely insubordinate to those in authority, seeing rules and regulations as unnecessarily confining. They will not usually go against regulations openly, but will simply ignore them. More than anything, They want to be free to do their own thing, and they are proud of their ability to do it with an artist’s skill."
ESFP,"They have the special ability, even among the Artisans, to delight those around them with their warmth, their good humor, and with their often extraordinary skills in music, comedy, and drama. Whether on the job, with friends, or with their families, They are exciting and full of fun, and their great social interest lies in stimulating those around them to take a break from work and worry, to lighten up and enjoy life."
ESFP,"They are plentiful, something over ten percent of the population, and this is fortunate, because they bring pleasure to so many of us. They are the people for whom it can truly be said “all the world’s a stage.” Born entertainers, they love the excitement of playing to an audience, and will quickly become the center of attention wherever they are. They aren’t comfortable being alone, and seek the company of others whenever possible — which they usually find, for they make wonderful playmates. They are smooth, talkative, and witty; they always seem to know the latest jokes and stories, and are quick with wisecracks and wordplay-nothing is so serious or sacred that it can’t be made fun of. They also like to live in the fast lane, and seem up on the latest fashions of dress, food, drink, and music. Lively and uninhibited, They are the life of the party, always trying to create in those around them a mood of eat, drink, and be merry."
ESFP,"The They’ talent for enjoying life is healthy for the most part, though it also makes them more subject to temptations than the other types. Pleasure seems to be an end in itself for them, and variety is the spice of life. And so They are open to trying almost anything that promises them a good time, not always giving enough thought to the consequences."
ESFP,"Like the other Artisans, They are incurably optimistic – “Always look on the bright side,” is their motto — and they will avoid worries and troubles by ignoring them as long as possible. They are also the most generous of all the types, and second only to the XXXX Artisans [They] in kindness. They haven’t a mean or stingy bone in their body-what’s theirs is yours-and they seem to have little idea of saving or conserving. They give what they have to one and all without expectation of reward, just as they love freely, and without expecting anything in return. In so many ways, They view life as an eternal cornucopia from which flows an endless supply of pleasures."
ISFP,"More than the other Artisans, They are in tune with their senses, and so have a sure grasp of what belongs, and what doesn’t belong, in all kinds of works of art. While the other Artisans are skilled with people, tools, and entertainment, They have an exceptional ability-seemingly inborn-to work with subtle differences in color, tone, texture, aroma, and flavor."
ISFP,"Although They often put long, lonely hours into their artistry, they are just as impulsive as the other Artisans. They do not wait to consider their moves; rather, they act in the here and now, with little or no planning or preparation. They are seized by the act of artistic composition, as if caught up in a whirlwind. The act is their master, not the reverse. They paint or sculpt, they dance or skate, they write melodies or make recipes-or whatever-simply because they must. They climb the mountain because it is there."
ISFP,"This ability to lose themselves in action accounts for the spectacular individual accomplishments of some They, and yet on their social side they show a kindness unmatched by all the other types. They are especially sensitive to the pain and suffering of others, and they sympathize freely with the sufferer. Some have a remarkable way with young children, almost as if there were a natural bond of sympathy and trust between them. A similar bond may be seen between some They and animals, even wild animals. Many They have an instinctive longing for the wilds, and nature seems to welcome them."
ISFP,"They are just as plentiful as the other Artisans, say nine or ten per cent of the population, but in general they are very difficult to observe and thus greatly misunderstood. Very likely the difficulty comes from their tendency not to express themselves verbally, but through their works of art. They are usually not interested in developing ability in public speaking, or even in the art of conversation; they prefer to feel the pulse of life by touch, in the muscles, in the eyes, in the ears, on the tongue. Make no mistake, They are just as interested as other types in sharing their view of the world, and if they find a medium of non-verbal communication-some art form-then they will express their character quite eloquently. If not, they simply remain unknown, their quietness leaving their character all but invisible."
ENFJ,"Even more than the other Idealists,They have a natural talent for leading students or trainees toward learning, or as Idealists like to think of it, they are capable of calling forth each learner’s potentials. They (around two percent of the population) are able – effortlessly, it seems, and almost endlessly-to dream up fascinating learning activities for their students to engage in. In some They, this ability to fire the imagination can amount to a kind of genius which other types find hard to emulate. But perhaps their greatest strength lies in their belief in their students. They look for the best in their students, and communicate clearly that each one has untold potential, and this confidence can inspire their students to grow and develop more than they ever thought possible."
ENFJ,"In whatever field they choose, They consider people their highest priority, and they instinctively communicate personal concern and a willingness to become involved. Warmly outgoing, and perhaps the most expressive of all the types, They are remarkably good with language, especially when communicating in speech, face to face. And they do not hesitate to speak out and let their feelings be known. Bubbling with enthusiasm, They will voice their passions with dramatic flourish, and can, with practice, become charismatic public speakers. This verbal ability gives They a good deal of influence in groups, and they are often asked to take a leadership role."
ENFJ,"They like things settled and organized, and will schedule their work hours and social engagements well ahead of time — and they are absolutely trustworthy in honoring these commitments. Valuing as they do interpersonal cooperation and harmonious relations, They are extraordinarily tolerant of others, are easy to get along with, and are usually popular wherever they are."
ENFJ,"They are highly sensitive to others, which is to say their intuition tends to be well developed. Certainly their insight into themselves and others is unparalleled. Without a doubt, they know what is going on inside themselves, and they can read other people with uncanny accuracy. They also identify with others quite easily, and will actually find themselves picking up the characteristics, emotions, and beliefs of those around them. Because they slip almost unconsciously into other people’s skin in this way, They feel closely connected with those around them, and thus show a sincere interest in the joys and problems of their employees, colleagues, students, clients, and loved ones."
INFJ,"They have an exceptionally strong desire to contribute to the welfare of others, and find great personal fulfillment interacting with people, nurturing their personal development, guiding them to realize their human potential. Although they are happy working at jobs (such as writing) that require solitude and close attention, They do quite well with individuals or groups of people, provided that the personal interactions are not superficial, and that they find some quiet, private time every now and then to recharge their batteries. They are both kind and positive in their handling of others; they are great listeners and seem naturally interested in helping people with their personal problems. Not usually visible leaders, They prefer to work intensely with those close to them, especially on a one-to-one basis, quietly exerting their influence behind the scenes."
INFJ,"They are scarce, little more than three percent of the population, and can be hard to get to know, since they tend not to share their innermost thoughts or their powerful emotional reactions except with their loved ones. They are highly private people, with an unusually rich, complicated inner life. Friends or colleagues who have known them for years may find sides emerging which come as a surprise. Not that They are flighty or scattered; they value their integrity a great deal, but they have mysterious, intricately woven personalities which sometimes puzzle even them."
INFJ,"They tend to work effectively in organizations. They value staff harmony and make every effort to help an organization run smoothly and pleasantly. They understand and use human systems creatively, and are good at consulting and cooperating with others. As employees or employers, They are concerned with people’s feelings and are able to act as a barometer of the feelings within the organization."
INFJ,"Blessed with vivid imaginations, They are often seen as the most poetical of all the types, and in fact they use a lot of poetic imagery in their everyday language. Their great talent for language-both written and spoken-is usually directed toward communicating with people in a personalized way. They are highly intuitive and can recognize another’s emotions or intentions – good or evil – even before that person is aware of them. They themselves can seldom tell how they came to read others’ feelings so keenly. This extreme sensitivity to others could very well be the basis of the XXXX’s remarkable ability to experience a whole array of psychic phenomena."
ENFP,"Like the other Idealists, They are rather rare, say three or four percent of the population, but even more than the others they consider intense emotional experiences as being vital to a full life. They have a wide range and variety of emotions, and a great passion for novelty. They see life as an exciting drama, pregnant with possibilities for both good and evil, and they want to experience all the meaningful events and fascinating people in the world. The most outgoing of the Idealists, They often can’t wait to tell others of their extraordinary experiences. They can be tireless in talking with others, like fountains that bubble and splash, spilling over their own words to get it all out. And usually this is not simple storytelling; They often speak (or write) in the hope of revealing some truth about human experience, or of motivating others with their powerful convictions. Their strong drive to speak out on issues and events, along with their boundless enthusiasm and natural talent with language, makes them the most vivacious and inspiring of all the types."
ENFP,"Fiercely individualistic, They strive toward a kind of personal authenticity, and this intention always to be themselves is usually quite attractive to others. At the same time, They have outstanding intuitive powers and can tell what is going on inside of others, reading hidden emotions and giving special significance to words or actions. In fact, They are constantly scanning the social environment, and no intriguing character or silent motive is likely to escape their attention. Far more than the other Idealists, They are keen and probing observers of the people around them, and are capable of intense concentration on another individual. Their attention is rarely passive or casual. On the contrary, They tend to be extra sensitive and alert, always ready for emergencies, always on the lookout for what’s possible."
ENFP,"They are good with people and usually have a wide range of personal relationships. They are warm and full of energy with their friends. They are likable and at ease with colleagues, and handle their employees or students with great skill. They are good in public and on the telephone, and are so spontaneous and dramatic that others love to be in their company. They are positive, exuberant people, and often their confidence in the goodness of life and of human nature makes good things happen."
INFP,"They present a calm and serene face to the world, and can seem shy, even distant around others. But inside they’re anything but serene, having a capacity for personal caring rarely found in the other types. They care deeply about the inner life of a few special persons, or about a favorite cause in the world at large. And their great passion is to heal the conflicts that trouble individuals, or that divide groups, and thus to bring wholeness, or health, to themselves, their loved ones, and their community."
INFP,"They have a profound sense of idealism that comes from a strong personal sense of right and wrong. They conceive of the world as an ethical, honorable place, full of wondrous possibilities and potential goods. In fact, to understand They, we must understand that their deep commitment to the positive and the good is almost boundless and selfless, inspiring them to make extraordinary sacrifices for someone or something they believe in. Set off from the rest of humanity by their privacy and scarcity, They can often feel even more isolated in the purity of their idealism."
INFP,"Also, They might well feel a sense of separation because of their often misunderstood childhood. They live a fantasy-filled childhood-they are the prince or princess of fairy tales-an attitude which, sadly, is frowned upon, or even punished, by many parents. With parents who want them to get their head out of the clouds, They begin to believe they are bad to be so fanciful, so dreamy, and can come to see themselves as ugly ducklings. In truth, they are quite OK just as they are, only different from most others-swans reared in a family of ducks."
INFP,"At work, They are adaptable, welcome new ideas and new information, are patient with complicated situations, but impatient with routine details. They are keenly aware of people and their feelings, and relate well with most others. Because of their deep-seated reserve, however, they can work quite happily alone. When making decisions, They follow their heart not their head, which means they can make errors of fact, but seldom of feeling. They have a natural interest in scholarly activities and demonstrate, like the other Idealists, a remarkable facility with language. They have a gift for interpreting stories, as well as for creating them, and thus often write in lyric, poetic fashion. Frequently they hear a call to go forth into the world and help others, a call they seem ready to answer, even if they must sacrifice their own comfort."
ENTJ,"Of the four aspects of strategic analysis and definition it is the marshaling or situational organizing role that reaches the highest development in the XXXX. As this kind of role is practiced some contingency organizing is necessary, so that the second suit of the XXXX’s intellect is devising contingency plans. Structural and functional engineering, though practiced in some degree in the course of organizational operations, tend to be not nearly as well developed and are soon outstripped by the rapidly growing skills in organizing. But it must be said that any kind of strategic exercise tends to bring added strength to engineering as well as organizing skills."
ENTJ,"Hardly more than two percent of the total population, They are bound to lead others, and from an early age they can be observed taking command of groups. In some cases, they simply find themselves in charge of groups, and are mystified as to how this happened. But the reason is that they have a strong natural urge to give structure and direction wherever they are – to harness people in the field and to direct them to achieve distant goals. They resemble They in their tendency to establish plans for a task, enterprise, or organization, but They search more for policy and goals than for regulations and procedures."
ENTJ,"They cannot not build organizations, and cannot not push to implement their goals. When in charge of an organization, whether in the military, business, education, or government, They more than any other type desire (and generally have the ability) to visualize where the organization is going, and they seem able to communicate that vision to others. Their organizational and coordinating skills tends to be highly developed, which means that they are likely to be good at systematizing, ordering priorities, generalizing, summarizing, marshaling evidence, and at demonstrating their ideas. Their ability to organize, however, may be more highly developed than their ability to analyze, and the XXXX leader may need to turn to an XXXX or XXXX to provide this kind of input."
ENTJ,"They will usually rise to positions of responsibility and enjoy being executives. They are tireless in their devotion to their jobs and can easily block out other areas of life for the sake of their work. Superb administrators in any field – medicine, law, business, education, government, the military – They organize their units into smooth-functioning systems, planning in advance, keeping both short-term and long-range objectives well in mind. For the XXXX, there must always be a goal-directed reason for doing anything, and people’s feelings usually are not sufficient reason. They prefer decisions to be based on impersonal data, want to work from well thought-out plans, like to use engineered operations – and they expect others to follow suit. They are ever intent on reducing bureaucratic red tape, task redundancy, and aimless confusion in the workplace, and they are willing to dismiss employees who cannot get with the program and increase their efficiency. Although They are tolerant of established procedures, they can and will abandon any procedure when it can be shown to be ineffective in accomplishing its goal. They root out and reject ineffectiveness and inefficiency, and are impatient with repetition of error."
INTJ,"All Rationals are good at planning operations, but They are head and shoulders above all the rest in contingency planning. Complex operations involve many steps or stages, one following another in a necessary progression, and They are naturally able to grasp how each one leads to the next, and to prepare alternatives for difficulties that are likely to arise any step of the way. Trying to anticipate every contingency, They never set off on their current project without a Plan A firmly in mind, but they are always prepared to switch to Plan B or C or D if need be."
INTJ,"They are rare, comprising no more than one to two percent of the population, and they are rarely encountered outside their office, factory, school, or laboratory. Although they are highly capable leaders, They are not at all eager to take command, preferring to stay in the background until others demonstrate their inability to lead. Once they take charge, however, they are thoroughgoing pragmatists. They are certain that efficiency is indispensable in a well-run organization, and if they encounter inefficiency — any waste of human and material resources — they are quick to realign operations and reassign personnel. They do not feel bound by established rules and procedures, and traditional authority does not impress them, nor do slogans or catchwords. Only ideas that make sense to them are adopted; those that don’t, aren’t, no matter who thought of them. Remember, their aim is always maximum efficiency."
INTJ,"In their careers, They usually rise to positions of responsibility, for they work long and hard and are dedicated in their pursuit of goals, sparing neither their own time and effort nor that of their colleagues and employees. Problem-solving is highly stimulating to They, who love responding to tangled systems that require careful sorting out. Ordinarily, they verbalize the positive and avoid comments of a negative nature; they are more interested in moving an organization forward than dwelling on mistakes of the past."
INTJ,"They tend to be much more definite and self-confident than other Rationals, having usually developed a very strong will. Decisions come easily to them; in fact, they can hardly rest until they have things settled and decided. But before they decide anything, they must do the research. They are highly theoretical, but they insist on looking at all available data before they embrace an idea, and they are suspicious of any statement that is based on shoddy research, or that is not checked against reality."
ENTP,"They begin building gadgets and mechanisms as young children, and never really stop, though as adults they will turn their inventiveness to many kinds of organizations, social as well as mechanical. There aren’t many They, say about two percent of the population, but they have great impact on our everyday lives. With their innovative, entrepreneurial spirit, They are always on the lookout for a better way, always eyeing new projects, new enterprises, new processes. Always aiming to “build a better mousetrap.”They are keenly pragmatic, and often become expert at devising the most effective means to accomplish their ends. They are the most reluctant of all the types to do things in a particular manner just because that’s the way they have been done. As a result, they often bring fresh, new approaches to their work and play. They are intensely curious and continuously probe for possibilities, especially when trying to solve complex problems. They are filled with ideas, but value ideas only when they make possible actions and objects. Thus they see product design not as an end in itself, but as a means to an end, as a way of devising the prototype that works and that can be brought to market. They are confident in their pragmatism, counting on their ability to find effective ways and means when they need them, rather than making a detailed blueprint in advance. A rough idea is all they need to feel ready to proceed into action."
ENTP,"They often have a lively circle of friends and are interested in their ideas and activities. They are usually easy-going, seldom critical or carping. They can be engaging conversationalists, able to express their own complicated ideas and to follow the ideas of others. When arguing issues, however, they may deliberately employ debate skills to the serious disadvantage of their opponents."
ENTP,"They are usually non-conformists in the workplace, and can succeed in many areas as long as the job does not involve too much humdrum routine. They make good leaders on pilot projects that test their ingenuity. And they are skilled at engineering human relationships and human systems, quickly grasping the politics of institutions and always wanting to understand the people within the system rather than tell them what to do. No matter what their occupation, however, They display an extraordinary talent for rising to the demands of even the most impossible situations. “It can’t be done” is a challenge to an XXXX and elicits a reaction of “I can do it.”"
INTP,"They need not be thought of as only interested in drawing blueprints for buildings or roads or bridges. They are the master designers of all kinds of theoretical systems, including school curricula, corporate strategies, and new technologies. For They, the world exists primarily to be analyzed, understood, explained – and re-designed. External reality in itself is unimportant, little more than raw material to be organized into structural models. What is important for They is that they grasp fundamental principles and natural laws, and that their designs are elegant, that is, efficient and coherent."
INTP,"They are rare – maybe one percent of the population – and show the greatest precision in thought and speech of all the types. They tend to see distinctions and inconsistencies instantaneously, and can detect contradictions no matter when or where they were made. It is difficult for an XXXX to listen to nonsense, even in a casual conversation, without pointing out the speaker’s error. And in any serious discussion or debate They are devastating, their skill in framing arguments giving them an enormous advantage. They regard all discussions as a search for understanding, and believe their function is to eliminate inconsistencies, which can make communication with them an uncomfortable experience for many."
INTP,"Ruthless pragmatists about ideas, and insatiably curious, They are driven to find the most efficient means to their ends, and they will learn in any manner and degree they can. They will listen to amateurs if their ideas are useful, and will ignore the experts if theirs are not. Authority derived from office, credential, or celebrity does not impress them. They are interested only in what make sense, and thus only statements that are consistent and coherent carry any weight with them."
INTP,"They often seem difficult to know. They are inclined to be shy except with close friends, and their reserve is difficult to penetrate. Able to concentrate better than any other type, they prefer to work quietly at their computers or drafting tables, and often alone. They also become obsessed with analysis, and this can seem to shut others out. Once caught up in a thought process, They close off and persevere until they comprehend the issue in all its complexity. They prize intelligence, and with their grand desire to grasp the structure of the universe, they can seem arrogant and may show impatience with others who have less ability, or who are less driven."
ISTJ,"The XXXX theme is planning and monitoring, ensuring predictable quality. Thorough, systematic, and careful. Sees discrepancies, omissions, and pitfalls. Talents lie in administrating and regulating. Dependable, realistic, and sensible. Want to conserve the resources of the organization, group, family, or culture and persevere toward that goal. Thrive on planning ahead and being prepared. Like helping others through their roles as parent, supervisor, teammate, and community volunteer."
ISFJ,"The XXXX theme is protecting and caretaking, making sure their charges are safe from harm. Talents lie in making sure everything is taken care of so others can succeed and accomplish their goals. Desiring to serve individual needs, often work long hours. Quietly friendly, respectful, unassuming. Thrive on serving quietly without fanfare. Devoted to doing whatever is necessary to ensure shelter and safety, warning about pitfalls and dangers and supporting along the way"
INFJ,"The XXXX theme is foresight. Use their insights to deal with complexity in issues and people, often with a strong sense of 'knowing' before others know themselves. Talents lie in developing and guiding people. Trust their inspirations and visions, using them to help others. Thrive on helping others resolve deep personal and ethical dilemmas. Private and complex, they bring a quiet enthusiasm and industry to projects that are part of their vision."

Devise strategy, give structure, establish complex plans to reach distant goals dictated by a strong vision of what is needed in the long run. Thrive on putting theories to work and are open to any and all ideas that can be integrated into the complex systems they seek to understand. Drive themselves hard to master what is needed to make progress toward goals."
ISTP,"The theme for the XXXX is action-driven problem solving. Talents lie in operating all kinds of tools and instruments and using frameworks for solving problems. Keen observers of the environment, they are a storehouse of data and facts relevant to analyzing and solving problems. Thrive on challenging situations and having the freedom to craft clever solutions and do whatever it takes to fix things and make them work. Take pride in their skill and virtuosity, which they seem to effortlessly acquire."
ISFP,"Theme is composing, using whatever is at hand to get a harmonious, aesthetic result. Talents lie in combining, varying, and improvising, frequently in the arts but also in business and elsewhere. With their senses keenly tuned in they become totally absorbed in the action of the moment, finding just what fits the situation or the composition. Thrive on having the freedom to vary what they do until they get just the right effect. Take action to help others and demonstrate values. Kind and sensitive to the suffering of others."
INFP,"The theme for the XXXX is advocacy and integrity. Talents lie in helping people clarify issues, values, and identity. Support anything that allows the unfolding of the person. Encourage growth and development with quiet enthusiasm. Loyal advocates and champions, caring deeply about their causes and a few special people.

Interested in contemplating life's mysteries, virtues, and vices in their search for wholeness. Thrive on healing conflicts, within and between, and taking people to the center of themselves."
ESTP,"The theme for They is promoting. Talents lie in persuading others and expediting to make things happen. Have an engaging, winning style that others are drawn to. Adept at picking up on minimal nonverbal cues. Anticipate the actions and reactions of others and thus win their confidence. Like the excitement and challenge of negotiating, selling, making deals, arbitrating, and in general, achieving the impossible. Thrive on action and the freedom to use all resources at hand to get desired outcomes."
ESFP,"The theme for They is performance. Warm, charming, and witty. Want to impact and help others, to evoke their enjoyment, and to stimulate them to act. Want to make a difference and do something meaningful. Often masterful at showmanship, entertaining, motivating, and presenting. Thrive on social interaction, joyful living, and the challenge of the unknown. Like helping people get what they want and need, facilitating them to get results."
ENFP,"The theme for They is inspiration, both of themselves and others. Talents lie in grasping profound significance, revealing truths, and motivating others. Very perceptive of others' hidden motives and purposes. Interested in everything about individuals and their stories as long as they are genuine. Contagious enthusiasm for 'causes' that further good and develop latent potential and the same zeal for disclosing dishonesty and inauthenticity. Frequently moved to enthusiastically communicate their "message.""

Talents lie in developing ideas into functional and innovative applications that are the first of their kind. Thrive on finding new ways to use theories to make systems more efficient and people better off. Hunger for new projects.

ESTJ,"The theme for They is inventing, finding ingenious solutions to people and technical problems. Talents lie in developing ideas into functional and innovative applications that are the first of their kind. Thrive on finding new ways to use theories to make systems more efficient and people better off. Hunger for new projects. Have faith in their ability to instantly come up with new approaches that will work. Engineers of human relationships and systems as well as in the more scientific and technological domains."

Genuinely concerned about the welfare of others, making sure they are comfortable and involved. Use their sociability to nurture established institutions. Warm, considerate, thoughtful, friendly. Want to please and maintain harmonious relationships. Thrive on helping others and bringing people together."
ENFJ,"The theme for They is mentoring and leading people to achieve their potential and become more of who they are. Talents lie in empathizing with profound interpersonal insight and in influencing others to learn, grow, and develop. Lead using their exceptional communication skills, enthusiasm, and warmth to gain cooperation toward meeting the ideals they hold for the individual or the organization. Catalysts who draw out the best in others. Thrive on empathic connections. Frequently called on to help others with personal problems."
ENTJ,"The theme for They is directing and mobilizing. Talents lie in developing policy, establishing plans, coordinating and sequencing events, and implementing strategy. Excel at directing others in reaching the goals dictated by their strong vision of the organization. Thrive on marshaling forces to get plans into action. Natural organization builders and almost always find themselves taking charge in ineffective situations. Enjoy creating efficiently structured systems and setting priorities to achieve goals."
INFJ,"They are a rare personality type, making up only 1% of the population. These deep, insightful personalities combine insight, intellect, and empathy to “read” people in a way that is almost uncanny. They seem to “just know” about people and situations and how events will unfold. With this intuition, they are constantly looking ahead to determine what will happen in the future. They also have a gift for understanding people and identifying their underlying needs and emotions. They care deeply about the human race and want to help people by listening, counseling, and emotionally supporting them. If you look at many of our great philosophers and authors, you will find a plethora of They; people like Dante Alighieri, Carl Jung, Agatha Christie, and even J.K. Rowling!"
INFJ,"In childhood, They are fascinated by the unknown and the existential. They often seem more serious than other children their age, but they can quickly brighten up when they are in the company of a close friend or family member. They enjoy deep, loyal relationships and usually only want one or two friends rather than a large group. During childhood their intuition is developing rapidly. They seem to get inexplicable senses of knowing without even understanding why. For example, they might suddenly sense that someone they love is in pain, and feel a need to check on them even though there are no outer signs that anything is wrong. As they get older they learn to refine their intuition and learn what to trust."
INFJ,"They have a unique ability to empathize with other individuals. They can shift perspectives between many other people and instantly imagine what it must be like to be in their shoes. Because of this, they are often excellent peacemakers and counselors. It bothers them deeply when other people make snap judgments about people without making an effort to understand their situation or perspective. They often believe that with enough insight, almost anyone can be understood and empathized with. Even their enemies."
INFJ,"Even with their gift for empathy and understanding, many They grapple with feelings of loneliness. As a rare and often misunderstood type, they often feel like it’s difficult to find like-minded friends."
INFJ,"They have a unique ability to forecast how situations and events will play out. They tend to think forward and envision future scenarios with relative ease. Their goal is to find out where the “last domino will fall.” Seeing the ripple effects of situations tends to come naturally to them, so over time people learn to trust them for their hunches rather than dismiss them. They often just know when someone has ulterior motives or they may be able to instantly see the way a relationship could play out in both positive and negative ways many years down the road."
INFJ,"They take their romantic relationships very seriously for the most part. Many They are actually quite happy being single and don’t feel a particular compulsion to settle down or “find” romance. They would much rather be alone than with someone who isn’t ideal, and so they don’t mind taking their time to find a partner who has depth, sincerity, and they can actually see a future with. As introverts, They generally find a lot of happiness in their alone time and can actually feel overwhelmed when entering a relationship as they find themselves constantly thinking of the needs of the other person and having less of that quiet, tranquil time to themselves."
INFJ,"The idealism of the XXXX is both a blessing and a curse in romantic relationships. On the one hand, they are careful and cautious when entering new relationships. On the other hand, they can be overly perfectionistic and feel disappointed when their partners inevitably fail to live up to their ideals."
INFJ,"When They are committed to someone, they are extremely loyal and giving. They are willing to put their own needs on the backburner on many occasions to take care of the needs of their loved ones. They are warm, empathetic, nurturing, and generous. They want their partners to feel their unconditional love and sometimes they may go too far; giving too much of themselves and losing themselves in the needs of their partner. It’s important for They to give themselves space, to consider their own needs, and to get regular alone time so they can remember their goals, values, and personal desires."
INFJ,"More than anything, They want a relationship with depth. They aren’t interested in shallow flings or small talk and movies, they want a near-spiritual connection with their partner. They want to understand them in the deepest possible way, both the good side and the dark side. The more honest and sincere their partner is with them, the happier the XXXX will be. However, if their partner keeps them at arm’s length or tries to hide things from them they will quickly pick up on it and tire of the relationship."
INFJ,"They naturally pick up on the emotions and struggles of other people. They deeply desire to improve their lives in a therapeutic way, listening to their stories, and finding creative solutions for their anxieties and concerns. Their insight into human nature and their unique ability to see underlying implications and meanings make them cognizant of many internalized battles that people aren’t even aware of themselves. With the proper training, they can be exceptionally gifted as counselors, psychologists, religious workers, or even artists. In fact, according to the MBTI® Manual They are over-represented as counselors and psychiatrists."
INFJ,"Market Research Analyst, Writer, Social Worker, College Professor, Filmmaker, Mediator, Holistic Health Practitioner, Special Education Teacher, Educational Consultant."
INFJ,"Unhealthy They tend to play ego-defensive survival games when they feel threatened, insecure or forced to conform. During these phases, they tend to shut out emotions and become almost robotic in their actions and decisions. They will appear perfectionistic and impatient, hoping that they can prove themselves by realizing their vision or idea. They often misinterpret other people and assume that they dislike them or even hate them. They will appear unusually judgmental and self-righteous and may convince themselves that they are misfits that nobody could possibly understand. They will feel torn between caring what other people think of them and trying to sever any dependence on others."
INFJ,"Healthy They are comfortable with the fact that not everyone will like them or see things in the same way that they do. They can enjoy activities that are purely leisurely without feeling like they must put every minute of their time towards their vision. They enjoy learning from a variety of people who are far different from themselves, and this allows them to be more open-minded and accepting. They are slow to label others as superficial or shallow, realizing that they may not have the whole picture. Their thinking and sensing sides are more mature when they are healthy, and this allows them to be more objective in decisions and more aware of their physical needs and the details of their environment."
ENFJ,"They are known for their unique ability to inspire people and bring about positive change in communities and cultures. They are intensely insightful about the human condition and have a knack for seeing into each individual’s unique potential. They are often called The Givers because they believe so strongly in compassionately serving the human race and improving the world. They use a combination of Xx (Xx) to empathize and relate to others, as well as Xx (Xx) to form insights about the future and the human condition. If you look up many of our great motivational leaders and teachers you will find a host of They; people like Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela, and even Oprah Winfrey!"
INFP,"They are some of the most insightful, deep-thinking Idealists of all the personality types. They are quick to listen, slow to speak, and generous in their compassion towards others. They rely on their masterful Xx (Xx) to form a strong set of internal values, and to empathize deeply with others. They also use Xx (Xx), which helps them to see numerous perspectives and creative outlets for the future. They can be iconic writers, groundbreaking musicians, empathetic counselors, and innovative thinkers. If you look at famous They you’ll find a plethora of talented individuals; J.R.R. Tolkien, A.A. Milne, Edgar Allan Poe, and Vincent Van Gogh are just a few!"
ENFP,"They are known for their incredible way of inspiring and bringing out the beauty and imagination in everyday life. They are adventurous and authentic, with a deep love of humanity and the world itself. They rely on their master function, Xx (Xx), to see numerous exciting possibilities for the future. They also have strong use of Xx (Xx), which gives them an authentic set of core values and deep emotions that they strive to adhere to in every aspect of their lives. If you look at famous They you’ll see a large number of authors, creators, performers, and philosophers! People like Anne Frank, Aldous Huxley, Salvador Dali, and Robin Williams are just a few influential They."
INTP,"They are known for their rich, intellectual curiosity and innovative ways of seeing the world. They have an endless thirst for knowledge, and love to experiment with new angles and methods of solving problems. The XXXX is not in a rush to discover, but takes his time, exploring new depths and new angles that other’s may have passed by in their hurry. The XXXX uses their masterful Xx to collect numerous data and facts and to explore systems and concepts thoroughly. They use their auxiliary Xx to see things from multiple angles and to bring a curiosity and open-mindedness to all their endeavors."
INTP,"If you look at the world of science, philosophy, and even politics, you will find a plethora of They. People like Albert Einstein, Marie Curie, Immanuel Kant, and James Madison were all well-known They."
ENTP,"They are the idea people of the world; they are in love with possibilities and strategizing for the future. They combine their dominant Xx (Xx) with Xx (Xx) to see numerous potential outcomes and sort them out logically in their minds. They are masters at coming up with innovative, enterprising plans of action. They make charming conversationalists, quick thinkers, and excellent debaters. You’ll see many famous They throughout history; especially leaders in the fields of philosophy and invention. Some famous They include Socrates, Benjamin Franklin, Steve Wozniak, and even Barack Obama!"
INTJ,"They are the intellectual, quick-thinking masterminds of the Myers-Briggs® world. Known for their love of logic and foresight, They live with a constant thirst for knowledge and discovery. They rely on their master function, Xx (Xx) to see hidden patterns and meanings for the future. They have extremely accurate and insightful perceptions about how various plans and concepts could develop over time. They also use Xx (Xx) to form efficient, innovative plans, create new theories, and organize their world in a logical way. If you look at many of our greatest inventors and physicists, you will find a host of They; people like Isaac Newton, Nikola Tesla, and Stephen Hawking."
ENTJ,"They are known for their strong intellectual presence and an impressive ability to meet goals and innovate with precision and speed.
