Fe,"Mature XXXXs are known for their ability to unite people.

At their best, they are compassionate, forgiving, have great negotiation skills, and always try to bring out the good in themselves and others."
Fe,"Immature XXXXs display the negative aspects of Xx due to getting too emotionally invested and not drawing appropriate boundaries, quite prone to confusion whenever feeling in conflict with others.

Flip side: Do you easily become dysfunctional in unsupportive social environments that create negative feelings like shame, guilt, social pressure, dissent, disagreement, negativity, indifference, ruthlessness?"
Fe,"Is it very important to you to feel a sense of emotional connection to others? Do you hope that every important relationship involves care, acceptance, and connection, which facilitates intimacy over time?"

Fe,"defines social relationships in terms of fulfilling promises, duties, and obligations to one another. interprets social relationships through “ripple effects” (how individual actions affect the well-being of others or the group at large). inspires people by being the focal point of issues about collective well-being, especially in times of social fragmentation or hardship"
Fe,"Xx-doms are usually drawn to careers or interests that allow them to: balance collective and individual needs; help others feel included and valued; use compassionate means to decrease conflict in society; improve relationships or analyze how people get along; promote moral values that lead to societal improvements or better interpersonal cohesion; organize and coordinate groups to achieve a sense of unity and cooperation"

Si,"When Xx is the higher function, a person tends to value what is known, stable, and reliable. This is because the lower (less conscious) Xx function makes a person less able to visualize the positive side of new ideas and possibilities, which means that the notion of “new possibility” tends to take on a more negative or frightening tone. The “new” easily destabilizes the foundation provided by what is already known, so XXXXs are often motivated to preserve what is known as a defense against (what they perceive as) the potentially existentially threatening “unknowns”. XXXXs compare incoming details against old sensory impressions because 1) being in touch with the known is an existentially comforting exercise for them, and 2) carefully ferreting out the new allows them to identify “potential problems” and prepare accordingly. The act of carefully sorting through details grants them a sense of getting ahead of the unknown when they do not feel adequately prepared for what might/could come."
Si,"Developmentally, if XXXXs frequently find themselves being bombarded with too much new information and are unable to cope, they are liable to take Xx defensiveness against Xx to extremes and become too closed-off to new ideas or experiences, perhaps locking themselves into repetitive rituals or routines in order to maintain a sense of security and avoid existential discomfort. Their adaptive Xx behavior - which normally produces admirable focus and conscientiousness - takes a negative turn when it becomes infected by unconscious fear of dark Xx possibilities. Until XXXXs understand that there are positive possibilities in addition to the negative ones that they unwittingly imagine, they cannot help but live in fear of Xx. This is why XXXXs tend to: be overcautious, overprepare for things, stay in comfort zones, depend on rituals/routine, assume/expect the worst, shoot down good ideas and even the people who produce them, resist change, or dislike improvising. However, if XXXXs learn to embrace Xx through mature function development, they become more open to exploring new paths and developing their creative talents."
Ne,"When Xx is the higher function, a person tends to value what is possible, hopeful, and inspiring. This is because the lower (less conscious) Xx function makes a person less able to appreciate the comfort and importance of a secure/stable material existence, which means that the notion of “comfort in sameness” tends to take on a more negative or frightening tone. Being defined by the past holds you back from becoming something better, so XXXXs are often motivated to pursue new possibilities as a defense against (what they perceive as) the unnecessary constraints of concrete reality. XXXXs fixate on certain details to imagine what they could potentially become because 1) fantasizing about the new helps them maintain a sense of optimism and momentum, and 2) discarding conventional interpretations of details opens up a path for transcending the mundane. The possibility of leaving the old behind for something new and exciting grants them a renewable source of inspiration whenever practical reality starts to feel suffocating or monotonous."
Ne,"Developmentally, if XXXXs frequently find themselves confronted with harsh practical realities that only serve to dash their hopes and dreams, they are liable to take Xx defensiveness against Xx to extremes and become gradually untethered from reality, perhaps getting lost in fantasy that is driven by subconscious rumblings of discontent. Their adaptive Xx behavior - which normally produces admirable hopefulness and positivity - takes a negative turn when it becomes infected by unconscious fear of being confined by Xx precedent. Until XXXXs understand that hopes and dreams can only be achieved with the right focus on details and incremental implementation of plans, they cannot help but keep running from Xx. This is why XXXXs tend to: be careless (skipping steps, glossing over important details, repeating mistakes), appear chronically under-prepared, buck tradition/convention, hate rules/routine/repetition, dislike negativity or pessimism, get easily bored by monotony or conventional people, resist being told “no”, or dislike procedural work (that requires them to carefully build on past knowledge). However, if XXXXs learn to embrace Xx through mature function development, they become more realistic about maintaining physical/material well-being and ensuring long-term incremental progress."
Ni,"When Xx is the higher function, a person tends to value discovering ultimate meaning, the underlying truth, or the essence of being. This is because the lower (less conscious) Xx function makes a person less able to appreciate and adapt to the constant flux of life, which means that the notion of “constant change” tends to take on a more negative or frightening tone. Ubiquitous impermanence threatens to obscure whatever permanence might exist in the world, so XXXXs are often motivated to extract some unassailable meaning/purpose from life as a defense against (what they perceive as) an unsatisfying existence of merely reacting to daily sensory/corporeal demands. XXXXs seek spiritual fulfillment beyond mere physical survival because 1) envisioning a meaningful life provides the long-term direction needed to ward off the shortsightedness of living only for today, and 2) having a mission in life gives them the focus needed to tune out distractions and define what is worthy of their sustained effort. The act of carefully crafting an ideal life grants them a sense of purpose when they feel haunted by the reality of being empty, nothing, or insignificant in the world."
Ni,"Developmentally, if XXXXs frequently find themselves unable to keep up with the many wrenches that life throws into the best laid plans, they are liable to take Xx defensiveness against Xx to extremes and become increasingly disconnected from life, perhaps held back by their own unimaginative and distorted beliefs about the “reality” of the world and how it inevitably falls short of their ideals. Their adaptive Xx behavior - which normally produces admirable depth and insight - takes a negative turn when it becomes infected by unconscious fear of facing Xx reality checks. Until XXXXs understand that there is no such thing as perfection and finally learn to accept that what makes life interesting and worth living is actually its “messiness” and unpredictability, they cannot help but live in fear of Xx. This is why XXXXs tend to: get stuck in their heads and feel removed from reality, feel at a loss when lacking direction/purpose in life, make sweeping assumptions, develop unrealistic expectations, cannot easily let go of their ideas or ideals, become controlling or obsessive, distrust the environment and lack confidence in their adaptability, display a paranoid or nihilistic attitude, dislike people who seem superficial or lack similar seriousness, or dislike being thrown into completely new and fast-changing environments. However, if XXXXs learn to embrace Xx through mature function development, they become more easygoing and gradually understand that feelings of emptiness can only be alleviated through the messy task of actualizing one’s potential in the real world."
Se,"When Xx is the higher function, a person tends to value immediate engagement, firsthand experiences, and interesting opportunities for pleasure. This is because the lower (less conscious) Xx function makes a person less able to appreciate the pursuit of meaning and its value for living a fulfilling life, which means that the notion of abstract “implications” tends to take on a more negative or frightening tone. Useless and overserious speculation about possible implications detracts from the enjoyment of life, so XXXXs are often motivated to seize the day as a defense against (what they perceive as) the ultimately unknowable truths of human existence. XXXXs seek a fun and carefree way of life because 1) it is easy to conclude that the point of living is to enjoy life given the primacy of their sensory and visceral experiences, and 2) enjoyment is something tangible when intangible “ideals” can easily lead you astray into pointless conjecture/darkness. The pursuit of pleasure and happiness grants them something tangibly real to hold on to when there are so many mysteries in life that may never be solved because “meaning” is a matter of interpretation rather than concrete fact."
Se,"Developmentally, if XXXXs frequently find themselves feeling a creeping numbness that threatens to mar their enjoyment of life’s pleasures (as their growing tolerance for excitement demands more and more intense stimulation), they are liable to take Xx defensiveness against Xx to extremes and become increasingly reckless or indolent, perhaps unwilling to confront the negative consequences of their haphazard decision making. Their adaptive Xx behavior - which normally produces admirable presence and resilience - takes a negative turn when it becomes infected by unconscious fear of Xx complexity. Until XXXXs understand that there is more to life than fleeting pleasures and that enjoyment of life can be enhanced by reflecting on the deeper meaning of it, they cannot help but keep running from Xx. This is why XXXXs tend to: appear superficial in their interests, have a poor sense of direction in life, avoid reflecting on the deeper implications of their lifestyle choices, self-sabotage with low expectations, suffer fear of disappointment, suffer fear of missing out, have trouble committing themselves, dismiss good ideas for improvement whenever it requires sustained effort, lack confidence in their intellectual ability, have a poor/naive understanding of spiritual needs, dislike people who harp on consequences or seem too serious, or have trouble delaying gratification for a bigger picture goal. However, if XXXXs learn to embrace Xx through mature function development, they introspect better and gradually understand that reflecting on life’s direction helps them realize their higher potential and finally achieve substantive goals to be genuinely proud of."
Ti,"When Xx is the higher function, a person tends to value self-sufficiency, self-determination, and personal responsibility. This is because the lower (less conscious) Xx function makes a person less able to grasp the benefits of collective intelligence, which means that the notion of “interdependence” tends to take on a more negative or frightening tone. Social connection seems to threaten or erode individual freedom, so XXXXs are often motivated to preserve their sense of autonomy as a defense against (what they perceive as) the restrictive pressures of social life. XXXXs prefer to approach situations from an emotionally detached mindset because 1) an impartial attitude is essential for proper critical analysis and good decision making, and 2) exercising free will about when to get emotionally invested allows them to maintain autonomy in the face of constant social pressure. The act of choosing to be a person unto oneself grants them a sense of control over their own destiny when they fear being defined or boxed in by the social environment around them."
Ti,"Developmentally, if XXXXs frequently find themselves being bombarded with social demands and unable to navigate them competently, they are liable to take Xx defensiveness against Xx to extremes and become emotionally disconnected from the world, perhaps unable to develop a strong sense of morality or responsibility to others/society. Their adaptive Xx behavior - which normally produces admirable clarity of judgment - takes a negative turn when it becomes infected by unconscious fear of Xx intrusions. Until XXXXs understand that their knowledge and capabilities alone will not get them far in life without being able to work well with others (since being challenged by others allows them to work to their potential in a way that is not possible on their own), they cannot help but live in fear of Xx. This is why XXXXs tend to: appear emotionally blank or distant, find it very difficult to get in touch with their true feelings, react poorly to people who are too “feely”, run from situations that trigger their deeper feelings, lack awareness of important social cues/norms, often misjudge people’s motivations, have a cynical or distrustful attitude, keep hitting the same wall that blocks further relationship development, easily stray into overconfidence or arrogance in their beliefs (due to ignoring vital feedback), or (unwittingly) become complicit in immoral behavior. However, if XXXXs learn to embrace Xx through mature function development, they become more generous, socially responsible, and look for opportunities to use their knowledge and capabilities for making a positive contribution."
Fe,"When Xx is the higher function, a person tends to value feelings of social connection, compassion, and harmony. This is because the lower (less conscious) Xx function makes them less adept at establishing genuine self-confidence and clear judgment on their own, which means that the notion of “living for oneself” takes on a more negative or frightening tone. Pursuing self-determination seems to interfere with the desire to establish emotional connections, so XXXXs are often motivated to be compromising and compassionate as a defense against (what they perceive as) the cold isolation and amorality of only being responsible to oneself. XXXXs attend carefully to social situations and get heavily invested in relationships because 1) love is a worthy moral goal that makes society a better place for everyone, and 2) obtaining social acceptance is for them an easier path to feelings of positive self-worth. The act of devoting energy to people, relationships, society, or something larger than themselves grants them a sense of importance when they cannot find a means of establishing good self-esteem in isolation."
Fe,"Developmentally, if XXXXs frequently find themselves having their personal worth or social desirability questioned, they are liable to take Xx defensiveness against Xx to extremes and become prone to defining the self only through the eyes of others, perhaps internalizing harmful social judgments and punishing oneself accordingly. Their adaptive Xx behavior - which normally produces admirable warmth and generosity - takes a negative turn when it becomes infected by unconscious fear of negative Xx criticism. Until XXXXs understand that they have genuine worth and value apart from how they are regarded by others, they cannot help but live in fear of Xx. This is why XXXXs tend to: feel easily shamed by criticism and guilty about being “selfish”, lack the confidence to speak up for themselves (without enough social support), become meddlesome in correcting the behavior of others, spend too much time focused on others at the expense of themselves, become clingy or overdependent, find it difficult to keep their feelings in check during disagreements, dislike people who seem too aloof or uncooperative, or strive to become whatever their immediate social environment offers them praise/admiration for. However, if XXXXs learn to embrace Xx through mature function development, they become more self-assured and willing to stand up for what they believe is right in the face of social pressures."
Fi,"When Xx is the higher function, a person tends to value self-acceptance, free self-expression, and moral integrity. This is because the lower (less conscious) Xx function makes a person wary of how the system rewards compliant behavior that ends up eradicating individual identity, which means that the notion of “going by the book” takes on a more negative or frightening tone. Coldly calculating how to extract advantages for oneself puts one at risk of losing what makes us most human, so XXXXs are often motivated to honor their moral instincts and preserve moral boundaries as a defense against (what they perceive as) a system that is amoral, indifferent, and easily corrupted by the people who try to game the rules. XXXXs seek to preserve their identity and integrity because 1) it keeps them in touch with what is genuinely good, noble, and precious about being human, and 2) it gives them a reason to buck a system they do not wish to participate in. The act of standing up for identity gives them a sense of power when they lack the competence to join the system and change it for the better."
Fi,"Developmentally, if XXXXs frequently find themselves under pressure to perform well and meet the rigid standards set by external forces, they are liable to take Xx defensiveness against Xx to extremes and become psychologically segregated from the world, perhaps carving themselves into a protective corner and then becoming trapped in their own misery. Their adaptive Xx behavior - which normally produces admirable empathy and virtue - takes a negative turn when it becomes infected by unconscious fear of cold Xx measurements of their worth. Until XXXXs understand that facing objective facts is necessary for remedying the distortions of subjective feeling judgments, they cannot help but live in fear of Xx. This is why XXXXs tend to: make issues unrelated to them to be about themselves, be oversensitive to moral transgressions, struggle with low self-esteem or unreliable moods, have difficulty with sustained will and ambition, eschew “mainstream” interests to favor more personalized passions that reflect their uniqueness, become dogmatic or proselytize as they aim for “moral purity”, or unreasonably judge people as insincere or inauthentic. However, if XXXXs learn to embrace Xx through mature function development, they nurture the fortitude to change the system without succumbing to it, thus doing their part to ensure that individual rights and freedoms are protected because they understand through personal experience how harsh life can be when everyone is left to fend for themselves."
Te,"When Xx is the higher function, a person tends to value toughness, competence, and efficiency. This is because the lower (less conscious) Xx function makes a person wary of succumbing to personal flaws and weaknesses, which means that the notion of “listening to your feelings” takes on a more negative or frightening tone. Going wherever your feelings take you is a recipe for failure and irrational decision making, so XXXXs are often motivated to display strength of will as a defense against (what they perceive as) the weakness and wastefulness of “self-indulgence”. XXXXs point out structural deficiencies and solve problems because 1) it helps them build a sense of competence in knowing how to work the system, and 2) it is for them the easiest way to feel a sense of pride that serves to sustain their strength of will. The act of effecting tangible change or fixing what is wrong gives them a sense of usefulness in accomplishment when they cannot allow themselves enough vulnerability to get in touch with what they really desire to do in life."
Te,"Developmentally, if XXXXs frequently feel frustrated by obstacles or setbacks that erode their sense of power, they are liable to take Xx defensiveness against Xx to extremes and become too critical or aggressive in proving themselves in the right, perhaps sacrificing honesty and integrity for the sake of getting efficient results. Their adaptive Xx behavior - which normally produces admirable proficiency and grit - takes a negative turn when it becomes infected by unconscious fear of Xx self-reproach. Until XXXXs understand that there is more to life than being competent and more than one way of living life successfully, they cannot help but live in fear of Xx. This is why XXXXs tend to: hurt more than help when giving advice, suffer from black and white moral reasoning, assume that all people (should) reason exactly the same way, display lack of self-awareness when boasting or taking credit for successes, claim that those who are called “special” or declare special “needs” are just incompetent or making excuses, have difficulty enjoying leisure time and guard their private life when they fear being perceived as soft, have difficulty understanding why people would follow their feelings when it seems certain to lead to failure, or dislike people who seem oversensitive/lazy/indecisive. However, if XXXXs learn to embrace Xx through mature function development, they become more in touch with what is important in life and solve problems more patiently and effectively because of being sensitive to a wider range of concerns."

Si,"unhealthy Xx expression: I am unable to venture beyond my touchstones, habits, tendencies, rituals, routines, or past knowledge (of myself)."
Si,"immature Xx expression: I am insecure and fuss over rules and details because I fear overlooking anything that might unexpectedly destabilize me or expose my insecurities."
Si,"weak Xx expression: I have difficulty learning well because I do not pay enough mind to observing important details, rules, procedures, conventions, or good/authoritative advice."
Si,"healthy Xx expression: I know how to do things properly because I am focused, realistic, conscientious, and detailed when taking on a task."
Si,"optimal Xx expression: My hard-won expertise can handle most situations and I welcome new challenges as a chance to add to my knowledge base."
Ne,"Reflection and Inner Awareness: Without enough reflection and awareness of what is happening within, you will be much more prone to stretching yourself too thin and too far to the point of self-sabotage because of losing sight of the important things in life or taking things for granted. People with underdeveloped Xx often shun solitary reflection, easily bored with themselves, which leads to them constantly seeking excitement and even getting addicted to chasing mental stimulation."
Si,"Powerful Xx is always keeping tabs on what is going on within by making sure that experiences do not disorient or destabilize life, knowing to value the familiar and stable aspects of life in order to ensure that one does not move too quickly or take too big of a risk and lose everything important. Powerful Xx appreciates having the strength and fortitude to resist temptations/ideas that will be harmful or unhealthy. Looking before leaping is necessary for preserving your past gains, so Xx treads very carefully whenever possible."
Si,"Reflect on your physical and practical needs and whether you do enough to satisfy them properly. Reflect on your wants and desires, why you have them and whether they are reasonable and promote contentment. Reflect on the practical outcomes of your desires/decisions more carefully so that you are not easily carried away by fantasizing. Reflect on whether you are truly acting in a healthy and productive way or whether you are merely driven by unresolved boredom/discontent. Regularly take time to appreciate what you have and how far you’ve come."
Ne,"Without paying enough mind to practical details, it will be very hard for you to do things successfully in life. People with underdeveloped Xx are often overeager and impatient, thinking they know what’s what before they have carefully considered every detail, skipping important steps, sidestepping challenges, using shortcuts, chasing after random thoughts/ideas to the point of never being able to finish any task or project properly."
Si,"Powerful Xx knows that details determine whether you sink or swim, so Xx carefully sorts through and resolves details to ensure that every necessary step is accounted for, every precaution taken, every loose end is tied, every i dotted and t crossed. Powerful Xx understands that the prerequisite for doing anything successfully is to have a good foundation of knowledge that informs every action, thus granting you self-assuredness when you act as well as a comforting touchstone for when you get lost. The devil is always in the details and Xx is always right on top of them, methodically fortifying past knowledge with new knowledge to create a stable and reliable knowledge base."
Si,"Thus, to develop Xx: SLOW DOWN and make sure that you have grasped and sequenced the most important points/steps. Do things patiently and methodically by following procedures/methods that are proven to be reliable and effective. Follow the rules that lead to success instead of believing that they don’t/shouldn’t apply to you. Structure information properly when learning/studying to avoid poor memory or gaps in knowledge. Learn from your mistakes by examining the minute details of what went wrong so that you do not repeat them. Heed feedback or criticism that you receive about how to be more careful and methodical."
Ne,"Without exercising discipline and prioritizing your tasks well, you will not be able to make the best use of your time and resources. People with underdeveloped Xx often have poor self-control, unable to focus well or determine which tasks should be handled first, easily getting carried away by their own imaginings or fanciful ideas without realizing how much time is being wasted on frivolous pursuits."
Si,"Powerful Xx combats aimlessness and impulsiveness by building good habits and routines for maintaining physical health and psychological well-being, thereby cultivating the focus and self-control that is necessary for peak performance. Powerful Xx is in touch with daily bodily rhythms and honors them, knowing the right times to rest or work, to reflect or act. Trees need roots and ships need anchors, so Xx listens to the body’s voice within in order to set the right priorities and accomplish tasks at the right time, in the right way."
Si,"Respect and honor your physical needs and rhythms so that you take better care of your health and well-being. Develop better eating and sleeping habits, and learn how to eliminate or moderate poor/unhealthy physical habits. Monitor the body for signs that you need rest/recharging so that you take enough time to prepare well for work periods. Take time regularly to enjoy simple physical pleasures that put you back in touch with your body and its needs. Learn better time management skills and strategies if you have difficulty with planning, organization, or efficiency. Break up your learning or tasks into clearly defined incremental steps to ensure continuous and consistent progress over time."
Ni,"destructive Xx expression: I superimpose my beliefs/ideas onto the world because I do not require any evidence to know that my gut feelings are fundamental truths."
Ni,"unhealthy Xx expression: I can only see what is lacking/wrong in life and it renders me impotent/cynical."
Ni,"immature Xx expression: I am insecure and avoidant because I fear not living up to imagined ideals and having my expectations dashed."
Ni,"healthy Xx expression: I live my best life because I prioritize well, set meaningful long-term goals to guide me, and possess good focus for gradually working towards my aspirations."
Ni,"optimal Xx expression: My hard-won depth of insight helps me accurately visualize future potential and I derive a sense of purpose from successfully actualizing it."
Ni,"Powerful Xx connects ideas, delving into the underlying interrelationships between things that seem unrelated on the surface, thereby able to visualize multiple possibilities for how events might evolve. Powerful Xx understands implied meaning and knows how to use past knowledge to fill in the blanks of new situations. To understand the world is to realize that there are often multiple factors that have led up to the events of today, so Xx seeks to understand what they are in order to achieve an accurate vision of what is to come."
Ni,"Take time to dig deeper, question why things happen, question why things are as they are today, and inquire into what today’s events mean for future developments. Practice your speculative ability by trying to visualize what will happen next, e.g., in life, a social situation, a movie, or a novel. Reflect on how the past motivates your behaviors today and whether those behaviors will lead you into a positive future. Heed feedback or criticism that you receive about being more thoughtful, introspective, and prudent."
Ni,"Powerful Xx attends to longer term outcomes in visualizing good goals or ideals to strive for such that higher potential is realized in due time. Powerful Xx understands that what you do today determines your future, so it seeks to grasp exactly which actions will lead to the best outcomes, applying predictive patterns to one’s own actions in order to increase the chances of future success. Xx secures a better future by visualizing it and moving resolutely towards it."
Ni,"Reflect on the trajectory of your life and whether you are headed in a direction that allows you to better yourself and your conditions. Reflect on what you can do to create a better life for yourself and seek out those opportunities. Examine the standards or values that you use to evaluate “success” and whether achieving them will actually lead to spiritual fulfillment, and if not, change course. Listen to your needs and intuitions when they tell you that something is missing/lacking in your life and use it as a springboard to open up a new chapter, learning period, or life quest."
Ni,"Powerful Xx sees the value of spiritual fulfillment even when it is hard to define, even when it seems out of reach, even when feeling lost in life. Powerful Xx always feels as though there is a higher purpose for oneself and seeks to understand what it is, and while it seeks and investigates every nook and cranny of the world, it will slowly accumulate the knowledge and experience necessary for making the best decisions possible. The wisdom of life is found through the journey of life, so Xx never stops moving forward, never stops seeking for the best self that one can be, never stops visualizing how things might be better."
Ni,"Journal about your deepest desires, hopes, dreams, and aspirations to see where they take you. Put your life into a big picture perspective by reflecting on whether your life goals serve a greater/higher purpose than mere personal satisfaction. Try to look at things from multiple angles in order to deepen your appreciation of them. Make sure that you hear every side of an argument by taking time to consider minority, taboo, or unconventional opinions. Collect information/feedback from wise and knowledgeable people about how to live a meaningful and purposeful life so that your mind opens up to greater possibility. Take time to fill in gaps in your knowledge, especially if those gaps affect your ability to live life well. Engage in creative or artistic activities that take your mind to a higher or deeper level of insight. Take time to unravel complex problems/issues instead of dismissing them as unimportant or pointless “overthinking”. Reflect on how to bring all the fragments of your life together into one unified vision of who you want to be in this world and what legacy you want to leave behind."
Se,"Without observing patterns and spending time to interpret what they mean, you will not understand how past, present, and future are connected and then be more prone to choosing the wrong paths. People with underdeveloped Xx often act imprudently because of only taking details at face value, never inquiring into the deeper meaning/purpose/importance/significance of their decisions and where they will lead."
Se,"Without prioritizing meaningful development, it can be hard to reach your potential, so you will likely end up living a mediocre and humdrum life. People with underdeveloped Xx often have difficulty visualizing a better life for themselves, so they do not realize how much more they could be capable of if only they changed or improved some of their thoughts, habits, or behaviors."
Se,"Without depth of vision, you will not possess the wisdom that is necessary to live your life in the most meaningful way possible. People with underdeveloped Xx do not know how to examine themselves closely, to look deeper into their own motivations, to gather multiple possibilities about how to live life, so their decisions are often too focused on immediate gratification or material rewards while neglecting the spiritual side of life."
Se,"destructive Xx expression: I do whatever feels good in the moment, consequences be damned."
Se,"unhealthy Xx expression: I have poor focus/direction because I am very easily diverted into indulging trivial matters."
Se,"immature Xx expression: I am insecure and hasty because fear of missing out or fear of being blindsided drives me to make rash and/or reckless decisions."
Se,"healthy Xx expression: I consistently perform well in my activities because I am fully present, actively engaged, and enthusiastic about learning/exploring new things."
Se,"optimal Xx expression: I always make the most of what comes my way because I appreciate that time is limited and good opportunities are rare and should not be wasted."
Se,"Powerful Xx combats apathy, impracticality, and mental detachment by forcing you to confront the world directly and experience everything fully so that you never get trapped in your own head. Powerful Xx allows you to see what is of interest in the world and creates the strong desire to interact with it, never missing a beat, never shrinking from life, always welcoming and embracing life’s changes and challenges. Variety is the spice of life and Xx seeks to gather it and savor its flavors."
Se,"DO more, move more, engage more, initiate more, participate more. Look for interesting activities or opportunities to learn through hands on experience. Have fun with learning by trial-and-error or, even more exciting, trial-by-fire. Apply your ideas in real-life situations and accept objective feedback. Don’t try to stop or run from change but rather try to adapt to what happens. Learn to enjoy the excitement of experiencing surprises or causing change. Heed feedback or criticism that you receive about being more realistic, proactive, open, fun, or easygoing."
Se,"Powerful Xx combats inertia and boredom by keeping you in touch with how short, fleeting, and unpredictable life really is, filling you with a greater urgency and motivation to pursue your goals and desires, always ready to pounce on new details. Powerful Xx pays attention to change, alert and ready to move, able to accept things exactly as they come instead of getting stuck on what they might mean or could be or should be or would be if only… yadda yadda yadda, easily letting go of old baggage to have the presence of mind to grasp new opportunities. The flux of life is always opening up doors for you and Xx knows that moving through one door often leads to other interesting doors, quick to enter them before they close."
Se,"Be brave to say YXXXX, accept invitations, volunteer yourself, and initiate activities more often. Be more willing to try to see what happens. Simplify your life by doing things purely because you want to or will enjoy it rather than having to concoct complicated justifications. Do not default to “no” or “we’ll see” or “let me think” or “it’s stupid”… but rather be open, trusting, and commit yourself to experiencing what the world offers up to you so that you don’t have to feel passed by."
Se,"Powerful Xx is optimistic and cheerful, a real force of nature that motivates and inspires people to worry less and enjoy more, spreading positive energy with its effortless trust and openness to living. Powerful Xx is appreciative and grateful for the gifts and fruits that life has to offer as well as generous in creating beauty and pleasure for all to enjoy. Life can be immensely fun and Xx relishes every fun moment."
Se,"Be present in everything you do and with the people around you. Take time every day to express gratitude for what you already have and what you’ve been privileged enough to experience. Be generous in helping to make life fun and enjoyable for others. Spread positivity by nurturing a trusting and encouraging attitude. Focus on the good things in life and put the negative in proper perspective instead of allowing it to consume you. Find ways to beautify your environment. Enjoy the journey, smell the roses, have fun, notice beauty, appreciate simple pleasures… because a life without vitality and passion isn’t living."
Ni,"Without flexibility to engage with life, you cannot be open to adventure or live life to the fullest. People with underdeveloped Xx often limit themselves to spectating or speculating or imagining, sitting on the sidelines, making assumptions about how the world works without fact checking, talking themselves out of action, and never getting to see or feel firsthand what the world really has to offer and just what they are capable of achieving."
Ni,"Without grasping opportunities, you will continually miss out on things, feeling as though life is passing you by or living in regret. People with underdeveloped Xx often spend too much time overthinking, hemming and hawing, hesitating, procrastinating, keeping oneself “above the fray”, avoiding before knowing, judging before trying, deferring decisions until it is too late."
Ni,"Without appreciating the positive aspects of life as they exist RIGHT NOW in the present, you are much more likely to become cynical, ungrateful, entitled, nihilistic, or depressed, feeling as though your life is empty because of always judging the present state of affairs as mundane or lacking. People with underdeveloped Xx often spend too much time thinking only about future outcomes instead of enjoying the process of living and learning, often missing out on great experiences because of only seeing the negative of how things “don’t measure up” to some perfect ideal or final result."
Ne,"destructive Xx expression: I use my imagination to weasel out of work and responsibility, thus sabotaging my own growth and happiness."
Ne,"unhealthy Xx expression: I am easily lost in fantasy or waste a lot of time entertaining absurd ideas that lead nowhere."
Ne,"immature Xx expression: I am insecure and erratic because fear of boredom/smallness drives me to make careless, unhealthy, and/or impractical decisions."
Ne,"healthy Xx expression: Though I dream big, I can still carry out my good ideas and achieve satisfying progress because I think of creative ways to work within and around my constraints."
Ne,"optimal Xx expression: I am innovative and able to catalyze positive and lasting trends by uplifting people or opening up the world to new and better possibilities."
Ne,"Powerful Xx combats boredom and pessimism by going where the good opportunities are, always staying open to what is possible and what might make life more interesting, always envisioning new and intriguing ways to go about living. Powerful Xx sees the potential in everything and feels a strong desire to bring it to life, finding passion in chasing dreams and leaving no stone unturned in the quest to transform good ideas into reality. Possibility breeds inspiration and Xx seeks to maintain a hopeful attitude at all times."
Ne,"Do something different, learn something new, try something fun, accept more invitations. Be more open to new experiences rather than prejudging ideas. Stop comparing everything negatively against the past and instead be present with the interest/fun in what you’re doing at present. Seek out new ideas and possibilities by interacting with unconventional people, especially people you normally wouldn’t talk to. Break routines that hold you back, let go of rituals that serve no useful purpose, and push yourself out of stale comfort zones."
Ne,"Powerful Xx combats mental rigidity by creatively connecting details to produce new possibilities, able to see many different ways of doing something. Powerful Xx can easily generate good ideas because of not judging them as “crazy” or “impractical” or “unrealistic” or “useless” before even really exploring them. To be innovative first requires that you are able to see possibilities, and Xx visualizes many of them before passing judgment."
Ne,"Always ask yourself whether there is a better/best way of doing something and find the answer. Instead of avoiding new situations, challenge yourself to improvise and practice thinking on your feet. Shake up your life by reorganizing things or tinker with your living/work space to make it better. When meeting a problem or challenge, force yourself to brainstorm many ideas before jumping in with an old/default idea. Actively look for problems to solve, things to improve, and people to help. Pay attention to your hunches and see where they lead you. Heed feedback or criticism that you receive about doing things better, differently, or creatively."
Ne,"Powerful Xx combats stagnation and complacency by moving forward, making progress, taking advantage of good ideas to move to a better place in the world. Powerful Xx is willing to take risks and is therefore free to explore and venture at will. Too much familiarity breeds contempt, so Xx seeks out greener pastures to keep life fresh and stimulating."
Ne,"Take time to nurture creative skills and talents that refresh/change your outlook on life. Journal about your hopes and dreams, think about what holds you back from pursuing them, and brainstorm about how to move incrementally towards them at a comfortable pace. Improve yourself by addressing your personal flaws and shortcomings. Examine your past mistakes or disappointments and think about how you could have done better or made things turn out better. Brainstorm multiple ways to advance in your career, improve your relationships, or achieve lifelong goals, and put those ideas in motion. Ask wise and knowledgeable people for feedback about how to be a better person and/or improve your life."
Si,"Without open-mindedness to possibility, life eventually seems quite dull and boring as you become closed off to all the things that could make life more colorful. People with underdeveloped Xx often get stuck in comfort zones, resisting change, avoiding risk, making excuses, restricting themselves with arbitrary rules and routines, giving in to passivity, seeing the world with a rather fearful/pessimistic outlook."
Si,"Without exercising ingenuity and creativity, you cannot discover the best way of doing things or the best solutions to problems. People with underdeveloped Xx often mindlessly default to the methods/procedures that they have previously learned, preferring and even irrationally defending the status quo, often getting used to living with problems and difficulties instead of resolving them."
Si,"Without enough progress and improvement in life, you are not really living because nothing ever changes and nothing you do brings any real feeling, satisfaction, or excitement. People with underdeveloped Xx often fear what “might” or “could” happen if they make a change or if they do the wrong thing, always preferring to err on the side of caution, rationalizing away bad choices, sabotaging themselves, living in fear instead of living."
Ti,"destructive Xx expression: I use my knowledge and skills in an unethical/harmful manner because I only answer to myself."
Ti,"unhealthy Xx expression: I believe I am right even as I draw the wrong conclusions (and then make up “logical” excuses to avoid admitting how wrong I was when called out)."
Ti,"immature Xx expression: I am hypercritical because insecurity about being wrong/criticized drives me to prove that I am (more) intelligent, rational, or knowledgeable."
Ti,"healthy Xx expression: I know how to evaluate my strengths and weaknesses impartially in order to correct any thinking, behavior, or deficits that get me poor results."
Ti,"optimal Xx expression: I have clarity of judgment and possess the skills to construct accurate and precise mental models for guiding me in solving problems flexibly and strategically."
Ti,"Powerful Xx is able to clearly distinguish what information is relevant or irrelevant to a situation/problem because it values acting purely on fact-based analysis, even if it means admitting to being wrong, quite able to accept feedback and criticism as necessary for correcting oneself. Powerful Xx knows that it is not good to get too personally or emotionally involved in decision making as it blinds or confuses you, opting instead to remain as impartial as possible, treating oneself and others as equal “variables” in a larger system to be understood and changed/adjusted as necessary. A clear mind leads to clear action and Xx seeks to maintain mental clarity at all times."
Ti,"Step back from confusing situations to impersonally examine problems by using a pro/con or cost/benefit analysis so that you are working with a fuller set of facts. Remove bias by being completely honest, TRAXXXXARXXXX, and accountable about your personal needs, desires, or investments in the outcome of a situation. Draw clear rules and boundaries about your duties and obligations so that you do not overstep into situations that are none of your business and you do not allow yourself to be unduly influenced in decisions that are your own responsibility. Confront your personal flaws and shortcomings so that you are clear about your own mental, emotional, or intellectual limitations and thus know when to seek help rather than go it alone. Listen to feedback or criticism that serves to correct your illogical, false, distorted, or unwarranted beliefs."
Ti,"Powerful Xx uses critical thinking ability to identify problems, investigate them systematically, formulate ideas and principles for solving them, and is disciplined in implementing the solutions. Powerful Xx knows that continuous fact-gathering and fact-checking are necessary for creating accurate and precise mental models that help suggest appropriate solutions. Haste makes waste because acting on incorrect information leads to mistakes and having to clean them up, so Xx seeks to prevent mistakes before they happen by refining knowledge of the facts and reflecting on what skills one needs to act confidently."
Ti,"Make sure that you have all the facts instead of assuming, going impulsively with “gut feelings”, trusting unreliable sources, or jumping to conclusions. Ensure that you have understood the situation correctly by properly testing ideas/beliefs and obtaining factual verification. When you are unsure about something, get more information rather than thinking yourself in circles. Plug any holes and gaps in your knowledge or skill base with proper learning and practice. When faced with a problem or challenge, determine what knowledge and skills are required to resolve it, and either learn them or get help from someone who possesses them. When doing analysis, carefully determine which facts are relevant/irrelevant to the situation or which factors should be assigned less/greater weight. Improve your critical thinking skills so that you are able to dissect problems systematically and tailor logical solutions (there are many courses/books available about critical thinking). Make sure that you know how to evaluate information for validity and sources of information for reliability so that your knowledge base is factual and unbiased. Eliminate poor reasoning habits by studying common logical fallacies and cognitive biases."
Ti,"Powerful Xx thinks in terms of what immediate effects actions will have, knowing to hold back and investigate further when the outcome is uncertain. Powerful Xx owns the poor results it gets and looks for ways to correct mental models instead of avoiding or deflecting responsibility. Every system can break down eventually as conditions change, so Xx reviews mental models when necessary, in search of flaws or holes in reasoning that need to be fixed."
Ti,"Reflect on whether your beliefs are logically consistent and lead to (or have led to) coherent decision making. Nurture the willingness to quickly drop distorted, incorrect, or outdated ideas and beliefs. Make sure that you understand the effects/impacts of any given decision before taking action. When meeting a dilemma or challenge, work out the possible negative impacts so that you are prepared to face them down (as opposed to being blinded by wishful thinking). Learn from your mistakes by assessing what went wrong and address the reason/cause behind it. Solicit critical feedback for your improvement. Take responsibility for mistakes by correcting them properly or asking the people involved about how to produce a better outcome next time."
Fe,"Without being able to approach problems with an impersonal mindset, you will often feel too entangled or allow your own implicit biases to negatively influence the decision making process. People with underdeveloped Xx have difficulty thinking on their own for themselves, often getting mired in overanalyzing or circular reasoning, usually because they cannot acknowledge how emotionally invested they are in being right (rather than facing facts)."
Fe,"Without refining your knowledge and skills, you will often be misled by bad information and lack confidence in your ability to confront problems and challenges. People with underdeveloped Xx tend to make assumptions or jump to conclusions without doing systematic analysis, which leads to frequent misunderstandings or adopting the wrong approach."
Fe,"Without being able to calculate the probability of achieving a desired outcome, it is difficult to make resolute decisions. People with underdeveloped Xx cannot parse cause and effect correctly, unable to discover the flaws and contradictions in their own thinking and behavior, perhaps even misattributing blame for a poor result and then digging themselves deeper into a problem."
Fi,"destructive Xx expression: I am imprisoned by negative feelings and my own misguided value judgments."
Fi,"unhealthy Xx expression: I do whatever I feel so long as I can avoid feeling bad."
Fi,"immature Xx expression: I am insecure and unstable because I fear losing myself if I do not do whatever my feelings urge me to do."
Fi,"healthy Xx expression: My moral instincts are very reliable in helping me channel my identity, feelings, values, or passions into fruitful and beneficial activities."
Fi,"optimal Xx expression: I feel deep empathy when I see people suffer and work to ensure that every person has the freedom to be authentically themselves."
Fi,"Powerful Xx combats lack of self-knowledge by always touching base with feelings and using them as a reliable indicator of personal limits and boundaries, thus promoting unconditional self-respect and self-acceptance. Powerful Xx knows that feelings and emotions provide very important information about the relationship between oneself and the world, always making sure to protect or care for oneself whenever necessary. When you don’t know how to process your feelings and emotions and accept them, they remain unresolved and drain your mental energy, producing negative unconscious behaviors, so Xx seeks to always be in touch with oneself in order to lessen the impact of negativity."
Fi,"Listen to your feelings and emotions, where are they coming from, what are they telling you about how you’re faring in the world? When you have a strong reaction to something, heed that feeling and what it’s telling you instead of brushing it aside or always “powering through” without any introspection. Your feelings are good indicators of your weaknesses, limitations, and unmet needs, so use them as a means to honor your personal boundaries and prevent yourself from overextending past your limits. Accept that you are human and have feelings, journal about them daily or weekly in order to stay in touch with them. If you have trouble accessing your feelings, engage with art or situations that provoke strong emotional responses for self-observation. If you experience breakdown/burnout, reflect on how it happened and come up with healthy ways to prevent those conditions from occurring again. Do not allow negative feelings and emotions to fester unresolved by denying, suppressing, or resisting them, and if necessary, share them with someone to release their power over you. Improve your emotional awareness through studying emotional intelligence and building your vocabulary for expressing your feelings accurately."
Fi,"Powerful Xx knows that maintaining personal integrity means acting with moral integrity, because whenever you do anything that is detrimental to emotional well-being (either to yourself or others), you start down the road of becoming a corrupt and inauthentic version of yourself that in turn creates a corrupted and harmful environment for everyone else. Powerful Xx knows that the values of “the system” are not always set up to respect the needs of individuals, so it is necessary to have your own set of moral values to follow, such that you feel personally invested in making sure that the world is a moral place. Every person has their own unique experience of the world and Xx knows that a good system should ensure everyone’s right to express themselves freely and authentically."
Fi,"Learn to see the value in self-expression so that you can contribute something unique to the world around you. Engage in creative activities that allow you to express your likes, feelings, values, interests, and passions into the world. Do something to make the world around you more just. Reflect on your moral beliefs and values, where they came from, and whether they result in decisions that make the world better or worse off. Reflect on your values for defining self-worth and personal success, where they came from, and whether they will result in you being a good person and living a life that you can feel genuinely proud of. When you make decisions, always ask yourself whether you are being true to who you really are and what you believe is right, if not, is it worth it to continue? Ask yourself whether you sacrifice something important (i.e. “sell your soul”) whenever you are chasing a goal or validation, and if you are, reflect on what kind of person you will become by giving up the best parts of you so easily. Ask yourself whether your behavior is conducive to good emotional health and well-being, and if not, is the resultant pain and suffering going to be worth it?"
Fi,"Powerful Xx knows that the values you use to judge yourself are the values you will use to judge others, therefore, if you cannot accept your own weaknesses and vulnerabilities and even treat your own feelings as illegitimate, you will never be able to honor the experience and suffering of others, thus prone to behaving callously. Powerful Xx listens to pain and suffering and treats it as important for catalyzing positive change, thereby able to empathize with anyone who suffers, often compelled to help alleviate suffering whenever possible. Sensitivity to oneself breeds sensitivity to others and Xx accepts the burden of this sensitivity as an important driver of moral action."
Fi,"Reflect on whether your beliefs and values are respectful of people’s unique experiences rather than making blanket statements or stereotypical judgments (i.e. does your judgment lack context and nuance?). If you have done something hurtful or insensitive, stop and examine how and why it happened, how you should make up for it, and how you can prevent it from happening again. Take more time to understand people who have very different experiences than you so that you do not judge everyone only by one crude standard. Realize that there’s more than one way to live life, so be accepting of individual differences and appreciate that different people bring different things to the table (rather than expecting everyone to be the same just so you don’t have to change your approach). Be more patient and understanding when people have to express their feelings because allowing them to be heard is an important and essential step to bringing them onboard. Realize that your solution to a problem may not be suitable for everyone and be willing to tweak/negotiate your plans accordingly in order to ensure greater success. Realize that people must make their own mistakes and learn from them in order to grow, so do not try to micromanage or tell them what to do all the time, as that might impede their path to independence. Be more generous in unconditionally offering a helping hand when you see people suffering. Try to be more positive and encouraging instead of making the world a colder place with harsh criticism and negative judgments. Reflect on what you can do to reduce suffering in the world or make life easier for those who have less than you. Heed feedback or criticism that you receive about how to approach situations more patiently, flexibly, and sensitively."
Te,"Without being in touch with how you feel, it becomes very difficult to act in ways that promote proper self-care and psychological well-being. People with underdeveloped Xx are often resistant to reflection and have difficulty acknowledging and accepting raw/vulnerable feelings, which may eventually lead to unhealthy, immoral, or self-destructive behaviors."
Te,"Without maintaining congruent values and acting with personal integrity, it is very hard to find the right moral direction in life. People with underdeveloped Xx are often too easily taken in by superficial rewards or immediate results because they are not in touch with what kind of person they want to be."
Te,"Without sensitivity and empathy, the world would be a rather harsh and unforgiving place, especially for people who do not have the means to protect themselves from being exploited. People with underdeveloped Xx often have difficulty empathizing or being sensitive to the needs of others because of being out of touch with their own needs and feelings."
Te,"destructive Xx expression: I abuse my power/position to get what I want and/or believe that the weak get what they deserve."
Te,"unhealthy Xx expression: The problems in my life are caused by others being incompetent."
Te,"immature Xx expression: I am insecure and controlling because I fear ambiguity, powerlessness, and/or the impotence of not measuring up."
Te,"healthy Xx expression: I know how to reach my goals efficiently because I try to be strategic in my every action and build confidence by learning quickly from mistakes."
Te,"optimal Xx expression: I am a competent leader and a good role model because I know the right approach and attitude to achievement, accomplishment, and success."
Te,"Powerful Xx knows what needs to happen in order to get the job done and possesses the will to follow through until the end. Powerful Xx is confident in making decisions because of being certain that one’s actions will produce the desired results; it understands the rules of the game and uses that knowledge to strategize accordingly, setting a clear objective and implementing linear plans to get there. No pain, no gain, so Xx puts out exactly as much effort as needed to get the desired result, never wasting energy on superfluous or frivolous issues, thus able to make the best use of time and energy."
Te,"When you’re not sure what is required of you on a job, ask and clarify, and write it down. When your direction is muddled, set a clear goal, make a plan, and follow it. When you meet a problem, solve it quickly rather than letting it fester or get away from you. Nurture an objective attitude, don’t unnecessarily turn practical problems into personal problems that affect your emotions. When you meet an obstacle, remove it yourself or get help from someone who knows how (and can teach you) rather than complaining or whining about it. When you meet a challenge, face it head on and learn what you need to in order to overcome it, so that you are better for having experienced it. When you don’t know where to start, break the task or problem into steps/parts and tackle each systematically, one by one, one step at a time. Always supplement your decision making by doing an objective pro/con or cost/benefit analysis so that you can be on top of every important variable that influences goal achievement."
Te,"Powerful Xx acts to assure good outcomes, always directing attention and effort efficiently rather than wasting time with wishful thinking or procrastination. Powerful Xx does not like the idea of wasting time and always aims to be purposeful. Idle hands are the devil’s workshop, so Xx keeps busy by making everything in life into a challenging game to be won and conquered."
Te,"Remove distractions that prevent you from being productive. Whenever you do something, ask yourself whether it is useful for reaching your goal, and if not, why do you feel compelled to do it (i.e. what other reward are you after and is it worth the time spent)? When you need to do a task or reach a goal, plan out a linear route from A to B, write out everything that you need to travel the distance, and prepare contingency plans for things that are likely to go wrong. Always have a plan B. When you have a lot on your plate, make a to-do list in the order of most to least important and tackle them one by one. Schedule regular breaks for yourself to recharge properly. Prioritize and learn to postpone or delegate tasks logically. When your goals are fuzzy or poorly defined (e.g. “self-improvement”), then make a checklist of concrete criteria or quantifiable standards that must be met in order for you to feel satisfied that you’ve accomplished what you’ve set out to do. If a life goal seems far and distant, have self-compassion and allow yourself to baby-step towards your destination, as making constant small victories makes you less likely to quit or feel discouraged. If lack of skill is holding you back, learn what needs to be learned to achieve your goal. If you need encouragement and support, broadcast your plans and ask people to help keep you on track, download an app with regular reminders, and keep your ultimate goal on the wall to motivate you every day. If poor organization/time management skills are holding you back, get expert advice and learn better self-management strategies and habits. When you feel frustrated or disappointed by a setback or challenge, allow yourself time to blow off steam and then quickly get your head back into the game. Heed any feedback or criticism that you receive about how to be more productive, efficient, and useful."
Te,"Powerful Xx owns up to mistakes and doesn’t take failure personally (and thus doesn’t feel bad about it), and failure is used as a springboard for improvement so that a person is judged not by their failure but rather how they come back from it to emerge the victor. Powerful Xx knows that a sense of power and mastery comes from observing bad results and using a different approach when necessary, redoubling efforts to tackle a problem, again and again, until it is resolved."
Te,"Take a more assertive, problem-solving approach to life instead of running from difficulty. Brainstorm ideas to solve a problem instead of complaining or panicking. Figure out the exact source/cause of the problem and tackle it directly. Improve your critical thinking skills so that you can break down problems/obstacles quickly (lots of courses/books out there about this topic). Reflect on your past mistakes and work on improving any personal flaws, shortcomings, or weaknesses that produced them. Use your talents and skills in tangible and productive ways to feel more useful and confident. Develop a sense of purpose by doing work that challenges you to be better and sharper. Nurture a responsible attitude by using your knowledge/skills to solve problems for people in need of help. Take on leadership roles to regularly exercise your knowledge and expertise. Avoid self-pity or self-flagellation when you fail and, instead, think on how to do better the next time around."
Fi,"Without being decisive and competent, it is very difficult to feel confident let alone accomplish anything, so you will be more prone to suffering from low self-esteem or passively accepting your bad circumstances. People with underdeveloped Xx don’t have a good understanding of the rules and standards that must be followed in order to be successful, or worse, they don’t want to follow those rules out of spite or a misguided sense of rebellion."
Fi,"Without caring about results and outcomes, you are more likely to flail about willy-nilly with no idea what you are doing and why. People with underdeveloped Xx have trouble making decisions, finding ambition, and setting goals because they don’t know what they really want to accomplish and/or what they want to accomplish is unrealistic/unreasonable."
Fi,"Without a sense of responsibility and good work ethic, it is hard to persist and get back up when you fall down. People with underdeveloped Xx are more likely to shirk responsibility or rationalize away their laziness, making excuses for failures instead of working hard to improve their performance with each step."
Fe,"destructive Xx expression: I exploit people’s feelings and vulnerabilities for my own self-centered benefit and/or express myself with little regard for the social impact."
Fe,"unhealthy Xx expression: I am never to blame for my problems because it is always someone/something else getting in my way."
Fe,"immature Xx expression: I am insecure and oversensitive because I cannot draw appropriate emotional boundaries and only understand others by how they make me feel or whether they validate me."
Fe,"healthy Xx expression: I treat people objectively (separate from myself despite my own emotional investment) and know how to make a positive contribution such that every relationship is mutually beneficial."
Fe,"optimal Xx expression: I show genuine compassion and feel confident in my ability to foster a sense of equality, warmth, connection, and belonging among people."
Fe,"Powerful Xx understands that people connect through sharing their lives, willing to make time for others, willing to go the extra mile to show that they care. Powerful Xx knows that communication is a great way to learn and exchange good ideas, so it often tries to pool knowledge and use collective effort to achieve more than one person could on their own. Love is action and Xx knows to express it so that people feel it and come closer together."
Fe,"Realize that everyone has their own life going on, and their needs and desires are just as important to them as yours are to you, so take more interest in them and get involved in their life instead of expecting them to come to you. Use small acts of caring to build a stronger and more intimate relationship over time (e.g. check in with people regularly, do favors, offer help, spend quality time together, have good conversations, ask for help or companionship). Be more vulnerable in expressing yourself so that people know the real you and they’ll be more willing to share in return. Be more generous with your time and resources so that people know you value them and have their back when they need support. Express gratitude and appreciation for people so that they feel seen, heard, validated, and valued. Reciprocate kindness so that people feel confident that the connection is mutual and thus become more willing to invest in you in return. Work on your people skills, communication skills, and conflict resolution skills so that you have positive social interactions (then people will want to spend time with you). Realize that communication is more than just “exchanging facts” or “proving a point” and you might slowly start to realize the joy of having company."
Fe,"Powerful Xx has a very strong awareness of other people and how they feel as well as what people have in common, trying to act in everyone’s best interests to reinforce our shared humanity. Powerful Xx pays attention to people and tries to bring them into the fold in order to reduce conflict or discord, it understands that people are happier when they feel a sense of acceptance and contribute to something larger than the individual. When individuals are unhappy, it affects the quality of the group, so Xx works to achieve the right balance between the two."
Fe,"Pay more attention to people and how they feel because you might be in a good position to help or cheer them up. Working only for yourself leads to boredom and loneliness, so ask yourself how to contribute your skills and talents to make society a better place, especially for those who have less than you. Learn to put people at ease in social situations and you will also feel more comfortable socializing (e.g. learn good conversation skills or how to have welcoming body language). Adopt a “the more, the merrier” attitude instead of excluding people or judging people before you’ve had a chance to know them better. Initiate social contact and be the person to organize or bring people together instead of just waiting around or tagging along. Make sure that you give equal time to listening and speaking, and give people a chance to talk about themselves so that they feel included. Help create a positive social atmosphere by being attentive to people’s emotional needs and encouraging anyone who isn’t feeling involved to engage and share. Do not spread negativity by getting into useless arguments, contentious debates that go nowhere, or criticizing people inappropriately. Think more carefully about the impact that your words/behaviors will have on people beforehand, and take responsibility for mending the relationship when you hurt someone or betray their trust. Anger, hatred, anxiety, or fear of intimacy are personal obstacles to relationships that you need to work on and overcome through introspection and self-correction (and therapy, if necessary). "
Fe,"Powerful Xx understands that sensitivity and compassion are necessary for improving society because you can only solve social problems when you are aware of how people suffer and take action to alleviate it. Powerful Xx knows that when people feel respected and heard, they are much more willing to participate and contribute their efforts. “A happy worker is a productive worker” and Xx prioritizes this strategy when managing relationships/groups because it builds trust and unity, reminding us that we’re all in it together."
Fe,"Focus on commonalities rather than harping on differences. Treat people as equals and all deserving of care. Ask not what you can get from people but instead what you can give them. Lend a helping hand without asking for something in return. Join a moral cause and encourage others to contribute. Express empathy to people who are in pain and offer your support. Always try to understand where someone is coming from in order to connect with their experience, and ask questions and investigate as necessary instead of dismissing or presuming to know how they feel. When disagreeing, take time to hear the other side out and work to find middle ground instead of digging deeper trenches. Learn better emotional intelligence and how to de-escalate negative emotions during tense or difficult conversations. Understand that being human means having flaws and imperfections, so be accepting of them and have compassion for yourself and others, because relationships run more smoothly when people remain open and trusting rather than defensive and fearful. Resist any urge to coerce or manipulate people into giving you what you want because healthy relationships cannot be unequal and exploitative. Heed any feedback or criticism that you receive about how to be more attentive, considerate, and compassionate."
Ti,"Without sharing of yourself in a way that benefits others, it’s hard to connect with people and develop a strong social support system, which makes you more susceptible to suffering the ill-effects of loneliness and isolation. People with underdeveloped Xx tend to undervalue relationships, underestimate the benefits of relationships, and have difficulty forming strong relationship bonds, so they live life in a very self-centered way, unaware of or ungrateful for all the support that they get from the rest of society"
Ti,"Without being inclusive and fostering a sense of belonging in people, society is much more likely to be chaotic and fragmented as everyone only cares about their own needs and concerns, and this increases the chance of conflict/war. People with underdeveloped Xx often have trouble understanding the ripple effects of their actions on others or society at large, either not caring or not realizing how they really impact other people."
Ti,"Without compassion and cooperation, society would be a rather dark and alienating place, especially for those at the bottom of the social hierarchy through no fault of their own. People with underdeveloped Xx have trouble really seeing others and feeling compassion for their suffering, and they find it difficult to cooperate well due to being unwilling/unable to compromise."

They are generally admired for their sincerity or integrity when at their best."
Se,"When Xx and Xx are well-aligned, a person is assertive in pursuing their goals, very adaptable in working around environmental obstacles and taking advantage of favorable conditions.

Fe,"When Xx and Xx are well-aligned, a person accurately assesses the needs of everyone involved, very compassionate and capable in resolving people problems. When Xx and Xx are misaligned, a person tends to be socially insecure/inept and easily misunderstands people, trying to influence social situations with ineffective strategies that later blow up in their face (due to grossly miscalculating cause and effect)."
Si,"When Xx and Xx are well-aligned, a person reliably carries out their tasks and duties in a detailed and thorough manner, often already knowing the best methods for handling logistics and implementation. When Xx and Xx are misaligned, a person tends to be too stubborn, narrow-minded, or risk-averse, unable to discover new or better ways because of only seeing/accepting one preexisting/prescribed way."
Ni,"When Xx and Xx are well-aligned, a person has lofty vision, very focused on actualizing a meaningful/beneficial goal, mission, or ideal.

Ti,"When Xx and Xx are well-aligned, a person always seeks to learn the right knowledge for resolving problems skillfully, and their self-sufficient mindset lends itself well to fair and impartial decision making. When Xx and Xx are misaligned, a person tends to be too reductive in judgment, worsening rather than resolving problems because of reflexively dismissing other factors or viewpoints that need to be taken into consideration."
Fi,"When Xx and Xx are well-aligned, a person confidently influences the world to be more just, very passionate about creating conditions for everyone to flourish. When Xx and Xx are misaligned, a person always takes everything much too personally such that they get trapped by their own negative feelings, often engaging in futile behavior or getting negative results because of not being able to transcend the narrow confines of their own experience."

Si,"Xx is a function drawn to the concrete and specific details of any information presented. This leads to carefully moderated responses to questions or tasks. People with this preference believe in economy of effort, that performing a task consistently and persistently now will conserve the energy that otherwise would have to be spent later to correct mistakes. Because they are pulled to immediate concrete information, they often seem very realistic."
Se,"Xx is expressed in quick-paced reporting in factual, pragmatic terms. Often pulled toward action-oriented responses, individuals with this preference seem efficiently forceful about getting the job done. After giving thorough attention to the specifics of any given situation, such people often have a good-natured response that suggests that whatever the problem, it can be solved."
Ni,"Xx is pulled toward the future and toward possibilities. This function is like an inner eye focused on what could be, rather than what is. As a consequence, individuals with this preference often seem scholarly or studious, as if looking toward the center of a problem. This tendency may show up as, for example, a knack for summarizing a long conversation in one sentence. Interpersonally, individuals who prefer Xx are seen by others as calm and capable of concentrated attention."
Ne,"Xx has an enormous appetite for external possibilities. This leads to quick pursuit of ideas in conversations, fast-paced search for information, and interpersonal style that seems to adapt at will.

This function exerts a fun-loving attitude—an interpersonal style of active engagement in whatever is going on."
Ti,"Xx is a pattern often experienced by others as a detached curiosity. This curiosity leads those who prefer it toward active but quiet analysis of nearly everything.

Interpersonally, they may express skeptical acceptance of the world around them."

Resourceful with ideas and suggestions, XXXXs are often fluent critics and have ideas on how to improve just about anything put before them."
Fi,"Xx is often exhibited in quiet, deferent attitudes. Individuals expressing these preferences seem sensitive to the environment around them. Because the first response of Xx is to accept the other person, a great deal of energy is spent helping the other to be comfortable. Given the inclination to focus on values as a basis for reacting to events, individuals with this preference seem unconventional to those with a focus on logical answers."
Fe,"Xx is expressed in an energetic, cooperative fashion with attention to social interaction in sympathetic and friendly behaviors. Often given to expressive engagement with others, when Xx is being used it appears to be drawn to others seeking inclusion in social affairs.

Si,"Xx (Xx) tunes you in to the chaos, unpredictability, and unknowability of the concrete world, leading you to value whatever few signs you can find that have stable meaning. For example, the stripes of tabby cats might hold a particular meaning for you, and you might come to treasure that. As an epistemological perspective, Xx leads you to view anything from outside a familiar context as dangerous and untrustworthy. You are in tune with the fact that nearly all possibilities lead to destruction. For example, if you’re designing an airplane, nearly all combinations of the variables fail. Of the possible combinations of wingspan, wing placement, wing shape, fuselage shape, and so on, there is only a tiny subset that make an aerodynamically workable plane–and then only if you get a whole lot of other things just right, too. All of life is like that, only much more complicated. We live only in the small islands of the world that we’ve grown up with and are suited to us. And we can’t possibly know why these small islands are relatively safe. As an ethical perspective, Xx leads you to protect the integrity of the things and signs that we depend on. This usually takes the form of setting up barriers against the unpredictable. For example, saving for a rainy day (hardships come at unpredictable times) or inspecting buildings for fire safety (so people can trust that “being inside a building” is a sign of safety against the elements). Within these barriers, where all is trustworthy and familiar, we can survive and enjoy what is precious to us–for a while."
Ni,"Xx (Xx) focuses on what is inexpressible–the incommensurable and chaotic things that exist outside of any conceptual framework. For example, what do you hear in the theme-and-variations movement of Beethoven’s String Quartet Op. 131? There is a meaning there, but you can’t put it into words. Any attempt to put it into words will result in only a tawdry parody of the reality. Better to remain silent. As an epistemological perspective, Xx leads you to view all signs as meaningless or even deceptive, not necessarily connected to what they’re supposed to represent. The true reality is something that exists beyond all signs and appearances, and can only be apprehended by a kind of direct intuition. To learn truth, one must learn to see through appearances–to make contact with a reality that cannot be seen or said. As an ethical perspective, Xx leads you to hold yourself apart from and unaffected by the meanings that others attach to words and events–to keep your own vision pure and pursue your own path regardless of evidence, reasons, or the opinions of others."
Ti,"Xx (Xx) makes sense of the world by apprehending it in terms of effects emerging from a cause, or a harmony of elements. For example, the way a beautifully made desk appears to emerge from a single idea. As an epistemological perspective, Xx leads one to trust only things that you understand first-hand for yourself, preferably through direct, hands-on interaction. You must see for yourself how a given thing or subject makes sense. Knowledge must emerge from the concrete reality itself, not from preconceived categories or criteria, and the search for knowledge must follow wherever logic and the subject matter lead, regardless of how people feel about it. As an ethical perspective, Xx leads you to do what is best for the system regardless of reward or gain or social conventions that define right and wrong behavior. For example, the sense of “natural law” that guides Clint Eastwood to do what needs doing in Old West towns regardless of the law."
Fi,"Xx (Xx) makes sense of the world by relating everything to universal human needs and callings. For example, understanding the actions of a bully as the expression of an unmet need to be connected and feel important. Understanding that, we can see the bully without judgement: we can see him as a living being not so different from ourselves, seeking to fulfill his needs just as we do, but in a way that creates unnecessary conflict. As an epistemological perspective, Xx leads you to take whatever a person thinks or believes as an expression of that person’s unique nature–not to criticize it because it fails to live up to some externally imposed criteria like whether or not it’s “logical” or “appropriate”. As an ethical perspective, Xx leads you to act out of empathy regardless of the social status or “deservingness” of the beneficiary. Xx leads you to view all living things as equal in value, all needing to thrive in interpersonal harmony without giving up any of their uniqueness"
Se,"Xx (Xx) makes sense of the world by attending to what exists concretely here and now, and trusting your instincts. As an epistemological perspective, Xx leads you to believe only in what you can see and experience concretely, and to trust your immediate, gut-level responses to it. If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, sounds like a duck, then it’s a duck. Whatever a sign means is obvious and inescapable; if a sign’s meaning is not obvious, then it’s meaningless. Whatever is physical, immediate, gut-level cannot be faked and must be right. For example, if you sense that someone is up to no good, then you trust that sense. If you have an impulse to paint the town red, then you go out and do so. As an ethical perspective, Xx leads you to believe that life is to be lived right now, “in the moment”, responding to things immediately and without thought. What matters most in life is what makes the biggest perceivable impact, whatever stands out in a way that can’t be ignored. Xx leads you to develop a persona that is attractive and “hip” according to the conventions of your society and your time–to go with the flow without stopping to question the direction. If something isn’t fun, then don’t do it."
Ne,"Xx (Xx) makes sense of the world by seeing ways to incorporate what is known into a broader context–breaking through the limits of current concepts. For example, sensing, before nearly anyone else, that high-bandwidth communication networks would “change the rules” of commerce. As an epistemological perspective, Xx leads you to practice “out of the box” thinking. There are never any final answers, just more and more opportunities to shift concepts and make sense of things in new ways. Whatever we think things mean today, we’ll probably find out tomorrow they mean something different. As an ethical perspective, Xx leads you to take risks and dive into the unknown–stacking the deck to some extent by diving into areas that look especially fertile, but genuinely entering the unknown and allowing it to send your mind in new directions. If you don’t know, just guess! Try something, and information will come to you–but only if you stir up the pot. From an Xx perspective, life is a succession of opportunities to pounce on, each opportunity opening up more that you can’t yet see."
Te,"Xx (Xx) makes sense of the world by viewing things “objectively”: in terms of categories and measurements that can be defined in advance of observation. For example, defining the specifications of a wheel that make it acceptable for use on the road. Stable categories and measurements enable people to define shared goals and enforce agreements fairly. You can tell whether the wheel met the specifications or not; anyone can tell, because the specifications are defined independently of both the wheel and the person doing the measuring. As an epistemological perspective, Xx leads you to be concerned with logical and empirical justification. No conclusion may be accepted until it has been grounded on a firm foundation of other facts that have themselves been firmly established. What has not been tested is unknown; what cannot be tested is meaningless. As an ethical perspective, Xx leads to a life of “rational hill-climbing”: making every decision according to well-defined criteria for what counts as better and worse. You might not know how to get to your goal, but at each decision, you take the choice that leads closer to it: you improve your position at every opportunity. Moral codes in a Xx worldview emphasize keeping one’s promises. Justice is understood as a social agreement negotiated by all parties, which specifies rewards and punishments that must be enforced fairly according to objective rules."
Fe,"Xx (Xx) makes sense of the world by viewing it in terms of where you stand with other people: interpreting signs that indicate the category of your relationship. As an epistemological perspective, Xx leads you to view every sign as an expression of people’s loyalties. A simple example is that displaying a flag demonstrates your loyalty to country. What matters is how you go above and beyond efficient means to an end. For example, throwing a party in someone’s honor is not “necessary” for survival: it’s a gesture that goes above and beyond survival, expressing your feelings for the guest of honor in a way that all can understand. From an Xx perspective, words are never neutral descriptions of fact: your choice of words, your choice of topic, is a declaration of your feelings and loyalties. As an ethical perspective, Xx leads you to believe that “life is with people”: to understand one’s value and meaning in terms of your standing in the community–in terms of the people whom you influence and their feelings about you"
Si,"Xx scans the world for familiar sensory facts and details, categorizing them according to one’s previous experiences, thereby integrating new details in a methodical, sequential, or incremental manner. In this way, Xx builds up a database of personally meaningful facts and details that can be used as a practical comparison for understanding a new situation. Xx feels insecure because inferior Xx produces intuitions about negative possibilities in the external world, thus, Xx feels compelled to prepare for those negative possibilities by carefully sorting through incoming details, but it is impossible to be fully prepared because there are simply too many ways in which things can go wrong. In other words, at its worst, Xx feels chronically unprepared for all the things that might happen in the future - it does not know how to predict the future and skews towards negative interpretations. Xx can feel paralyzed about decision making or too risk averse because of this."
Ni,"Xx scans the world for patterns of contextual factors, remembering vague connections between objects and events (and not necessarily the objects/details in themselves), thereby integrating new knowledge into a vast subconscious web of interconnected abstract relationships. In this way, Xx builds up a network of personally meaningful symbolic patterns that can spark intuitive predictions about how a new situation will turn out. Xx feels insecure because inferior Xx produces a chaotic mass of incoming data regarding how the external world is constantly shifting and changing, thus, Xx feels compelled to look for meaningful patterns for predicting what might happen, but this means that it tends to overlook important concrete facts and details that do not fit into those conceptual patterns. In other words, at its worst, Xx feels as though it is chronically overthinking about what things mean, trying to extract clues about the “one true future” that will come into being - it does not know how to deal with changing facts in the world until some abstract meaning/pattern can be applied to them. Xx can become rigid and unrealistic in its future outlook or become too protective of one’s personalized conceptual vision."
Se,"Xx scans the world for new or unique sensory facts and details, interacting with them as quickly as possible, maximizing positive feedback from the environment through making the most of changing circumstances. In this way, Xx is highly flexible and adapts very quickly to whatever happens, learning fast and efficiently on the fly by adjusting behavior according to the feedback received. Xx feels compelled to chase after sensory stimulation as soon as positive opportunities arise moment to moment but, because of inferior Xx, fails to accurately envision how such actions will be meaningful for personal future development. In other words, at its worst, Xx becomes addicted to environmental stimulation and feedback - it does not know how to properly attribute meaning and sorely miscalculates the potential of new situations to produce (long term) positive/negative outcomes. Xx can become overactive or try to avoid any situation that is perceived as negative or having no immediate impact/resolution."
Ne,"Xx scans the world for abstract patterns/connections that spark new and interesting potential to pursue, wanting to realize change/progress as quickly as possible, thereby making the most of favorable environmental conditions. In this way, Xx is highly flexible and adapts very quickly, efficiently taking advantage of ideas to make improvements and move up/forward in the world. Xx feels compelled to chase after interesting ideas and possibilities as soon as they arise moment to moment but, because of inferior Xx, neglects personal priorities and physical well-being, undervaluing the need for past knowledge or incremental learning. In other words, at its worst, Xx overextends itself because of being addicted to chasing external possibilities, too easily distracted and not following through with ideas to their conclusion - it does not know how to categorize and piece together concrete details in a manner that produces depth of expertise thus creating too many gaps in knowledge. Xx can become too scattered, unrealistic, or absurd in the ideas/possibilities that it entertains, unable to achieve real tangible progress."
Ti,"Xx analyzes incoming data for precise cause and effect relationships, using formulaic knowledge to navigate the world coherently, thereby constructing a highly detached and systematic point of view. In this way, Xx can feel comfortably confident and self-sufficient in its own knowledge of the world. Xx feels compelled to remain detached because it erroneously believes that factual knowledge should and can be separated from human perspective and thus perceives inferior Xx to be threatening or meddlesome because people’s “perspectives” are inherently “biased” and considered to be “irrelevant” knowledge. In other words, at its worst, Xx becomes disconnected from people and the world - it does not understand the ways in which things are fundamentally connected and influence each other, unable to acknowledge its own role in social dynamics and thus failing to establish intimacy or proper reciprocation in relationships. Xx can become too narrow in its worldview, arrogant in its knowledge, or reject the necessity of social responsibility."
Fi,"Xx analyzes incoming data to see how it impacts personal experience, using its own state of inner harmony/discord to judge the acceptability of situations, thereby constructing a personal set of unconditional values to guide behavior. In this way, Xx can act in accordance with its own conscience, trying to minimize suffering for oneself (or other people who are perceived to experience similar suffering). Xx feels compelled to follow its own values because it erroneously perceives inferior Xx to be threatening and invasive in applying unreasonably impersonal standards and not treating people as truly unique individuals. In other words, at its worst, Xx becomes excessively defensive of its own individuality - it does not know how to fit comfortably into the system of impersonal rules and standards that all individuals are expected to adhere to. Xx can become overly sensitive to anything that might impinge upon individual rights or boundaries."
Te,"Xx analyzes the world for clear-cut and reliable causal relationships, using them to create universal standards of operation/conduct to achieve the best possible outcomes. In this way, Xx can feel confident in being an integral part of the world by efficiently achieving goals or competently solving problems. Xx feels compelled to maintain, enforce, or improve upon those standards because it wants to avoid the inner turmoil that can be sparked when inferior Xx perceives a situation to be nonsensical or unpredictable. In other words, at its worst, Xx overrides individual or personal needs/feelings in order to maintain structural order - it does not know how to incorporate irrational, idiosyncratic, or unpredictable elements into its plans or conception of the world. Xx can become insensitive in its treatment of individuals or too driven to define the sense of self through conforming with external standards of success or achievement."
Fe,"Xx analyzes the world for customary and reliable social values or codes of etiquette, using them to maintain or improve interpersonal harmony, garnering desirable social rewards whenever possible. In this way, Xx can feel like a well-integrated member of social groups, knowing one’s exact place within the social order and drawing personal strength from a firm sense of unity and cooperation with others. Xx feels compelled to maintain, enforce, or improve upon social values because it wants to avoid the inner turmoil that can be sparked when inferior Xx judgments lead to feelings of rejection or personal inadequacy or existential separation/distance from others. In other words, at its worst, Xx overrides individual or personal needs/feelings in order to maintain surface level social cohesion - it does not know how to incorporate the fundamental human need to be independent and self-sufficient into its conception of the world. Xx can become overly accommodating or dependent upon others’ opinions or signs of social status to define the sense of self."

Si,"Do a visualization exercise that allows you to wander through a pleasurable physical environment, imagine yourself carrying out the linear steps of an enjoyable physical task. Make note of comfortable, familiar, or interesting sensory details and allow yourself to relax into the pleasant sensations. This teaches you to focus more attention on your bodily cues and entertain yourself with your own rich inner imagery instead of constantly reaching outward for stimulation."
Ni,"Do a brainstorming exercise where you think of many ways of doing/approaching routine tasks, try out a different method/strategy each day. Examine the details of how each approach feels different or produces a slightly different outcome from day to day. This teaches you to visualize many possible futures and their implications as well as how things can change with even small changes in your behavior/decision-making."
Ti,"Break down and analyze the details of how you manage your time and distribute your mental energy on a daily basis. Make a list of your goals, what problems or setbacks you ran into, what you accomplished and failed to accomplish. Reflect on what you wasted your time on and ask yourself why you gave your energy to those things. This teaches you to clarify and reflect upon where all of your time and energy goes so that you can prioritize and budget your time more appropriately, helping you to see what aspects of life you are neglecting and whether you are taking adequate care of your personal needs."
Fi,"Engage with creative or artistic activities that allow you to channel or arouse your feelings and emotions in a safe environment, such as: music, painting, writing, engaging with fiction or literature (dramas, tragedies), journalling about your day and your feelings about how it went. This teaches you to acknowledge, explore, and honor your inner voice so that taking time to stop and introspect becomes an enjoyable and meaningful activity that enhances your psychological well-being and refreshes you for a new day."
Se,"Take up activities that require heavy sensory presence and engagement but that also produce enjoyable fruits with learning and effort, such as: cooking, gardening, crafting, tinkering, sports, group game night, leadership/volunteer position. This teaches you to extract meaning and interpret situations more accurately using your hard won concrete experiences in the external world instead of getting lost in your own murky perceptual distortions (i.e. believing that you “know” how the world works without adequate concrete evidence or firsthand experience)."
Ne,"Engage in a fun, interesting, or creative activity that you have been successful with in the past or that you are confident will produce positive feelings/results for you. You can use your skills to help someone in need or use your knowledge to successfully solve a problem for someone. This serves as a good reminder that you are more capable and knowledgeable than you tend to give yourself credit for, and it helps you recognize that positive outcomes are also possible instead of only focusing on negative possibilities or your feelings of insecurity."
Te,"With some outside help, analyze all the main decisions you make on a daily basis, especially the ones that produced a negative or undesirable result for you. Figure out what motivated you to decide as you did, map out your reasoning process and what led you to making that decision. Think of an alternative reasoning process that could have produced a better or more desirable result. This teaches you to shine a light on all of the implicit/unspoken values that you use to assess situations and to critically examine whether your value judgments are misguided or require adjustment to facts."
Fe,"Improve your emotional vocabulary and emotional intelligence so that you can build better awareness of your relationship with the world around you. You can write down your feelings, compose poetry, communicate with a trusted friend about your hopes and desires, talk more openly about your insecurities or regrets, make an effort to ask others how they feel about something and share your feelings in return. This teaches you that embracing a strong emotional connection to/investment in the world is not a “vulnerability” or a threatening activity, in fact, it can be quite an uplifting and eye-opening experience when done with the right intention."
Se,"Xx dominants tend to be spontaneous describers. They generally speak with very little filter, talking about details, events, experiences, or happenings that are immediately interesting or important to them, and they can be very keenly attentive when you describe new or exciting things to them. There is a genuineness, freeness, and even frankness in their expression because they are prone to thinking out loud or blurting something out and then perhaps reconsidering their words more carefully upon hearing them, especially if they received ambiguous or negative feedback in return. In this way, they often come off as being quite refreshing or entertaining in their effortless vulnerability, with some opting to utilize self-deprecating humor if they have embarrassed themselves or if they’ve taken their spontaneity too far in getting negative attention - they will hurriedly shake off any faux pas to refocus on what is immediately important to them. They are very quick to react to things and can adapt to a wide variety of topics/speakers when they feel a desire to develop the relationship, subconsciously tuning in to your microexpressions and adjusting themselves to you accordingly. They wish to see everyone having a good time, so they generally try to be lighthearted and humorous or zero in on people who are quiet/down and try to engage or motivate them, casually brushing away any negativity that arises and reminding people to enjoy the now. Sometimes Xx can intrude and make them aware that their statements might not be as simple, obvious, or matter-of-fact as they first thought, in which case they might stop in their tracks and ask a question to get some kind of response, reaction, or validation from you in an effort to determine whether they need to adjust their ideas for clarity or depth, and then express animated glee when agreement or insight is achieved through the spirit of good teamwork. Although, some might claim that you are “thinking too much” if you question them too intensely about their opinions and motivations because they tend to have a limited amount of patience for abstract and convoluted introspection. Look to their auxiliary function to see what kinds of topics are most likely to grab their interest or attention."
Ne,"Xx dominants tend to be little light bulbs that brighten up when an interesting idea pops into their head or when they hear an interesting idea from others, often expressing genuine appreciation for other people’s cleverness and trying to build on it or bring the ideas to life somehow. They show flexibility in being able to improvise or riff off social energy. When conditions are relaxed, they tend to speak with little filter, usually blurting out some seemingly random tangent or connection that was sparked by whatever just happened (unless they have been trained otherwise by an environment that is critical of this tendency). Because of this, their conversations can roam quite freely, even reaching very absurd or theoretical extremes, if there isn’t some anchor or person to keep them focused on one train of thought. Being very open to different possibilities, they can find it hard to be firm in their opinions when you question them in more detail, perhaps prompting them to hastily dismiss any details that don’t support what they are saying or abruptly change the subject to something they feel more confident about - some might even claim that you are being too “nitpicky” or getting lost in the details and not appreciating the bigger picture. Sometimes Xx can intrude and make them aware that they have strayed too far from what they should be doing at present, in which case they might try to get back on track, perhaps settling down to explore a subject they are passionate about in more detail or telling a meandering story that they believe is relevant to what is being discussed, and then switching gears when they feel satisfied that the line of thinking has been exhausted. Look to their auxiliary function to see what kinds of ideas tend to interest them."
Te,"Xx dominants tend to be explainers who enjoy talking about things that relate to their knowledge, expertise, or (desired) achievements. They often view things in starkly linear or categorical terms like beginning-middle-end, cause-effect, problem-solution, or right-wrong. Being strongly solution and goal oriented, they tend to interject, sometimes too abruptly, with suggestions about how to solve a problem or how to do something more smoothly, offering their knowledge in an attempt to be helpful or useful to you, and perhaps feeling excited when you can offer up an even better strategy or reason for doing something. When talking about themselves, they tend to complain a bit or tell stories, but they will explain the story to you in somewhat dry terms of what they did and why, or the steps of how they did something, or give an outline of the sequence of events, with all of the main points leading in a straight line to a pat conclusion. They often have a very personal pet project or cause (which can be a person) that they devote a lot of time and energy to and you will likely find them quite animated when telling you about it. They can sometimes jump to conclusions too quickly in terms of thinking that they understand you when they don’t because of a tendency to overgeneralize their own perspective and project it onto others, and it can get awkward if you try to correct them - some might feel embarrassed and express immediate regret for getting you wrong and never make the same mistake again, while others can get defensive if they too quickly assume that you are accusing them of being intentionally insensitive. Sometimes Xx can intrude and make them aware that they are just talking AT someone instead of WXXXXH them, in which case they might try to express themselves in a more intimate or jovial manner, perhaps by revealing more of their private side or empathizing more visibly in an effort to hold your interest. Look to their auxiliary function to see how they go about expressing and sharing knowledge."
Fe,"Xx dominants tend to be walking mirrors who reflect you back to yourself because of their (subconscious) awareness of you and your needs. They have a natural desire for others to feel at ease in order to feel at ease themselves (social harmony), so they are likely to unconsciously mirror your expressions, emotions, or body language in order to get everyone on the same page, sharing and exchanging with enough visible friendliness to break the ice and reduce any awkwardness or hesitancy (”kill them with kindness”). The implication of this is that their true self is not as obvious as appearances might suggest because it is often hidden behind their (sometimes perfunctory) social harmonizing behaviors, and the emotions they display are sometimes more likely to be an outcrop of yours instead of their own (though they might not be fully aware of that). Some are more open than others depending on their level of social skill and how anxious they are about being judged as not fitting in, with the more insecure ones being quite sensitive to fluctuations in your mood or demeanor because they fear offending you or being rejected by you. They will tend to talk about what they think you are interested in until you ask about them in return, starting off with tentative yet energetic small talk if they do not know you very well, attending to your emotional needs but holding back their private feelings and opinions until they believe that the social atmosphere is accepting and inclusive enough for deeper sharing. They can sometimes come off as a bit ceremonial or goody-goody in terms of wanting each person to have their fair turn and going to great lengths to ensure that everyone is comfortable, often showing concern about things that can potentially impact collective well-being. They want to understand people thoroughly and be understood and accepted in return so, if your words or behaviors do not make complete sense to them, they will seek clarification by asking you to explain your point or experience more fully, being quite effusive with polite praise or appreciation if they like you and seek to earn your trust and good will. Sometimes Xx can intrude when they feel that the interaction is not going well for them (i.e. if they fail to get the response that they expected and thus do not feel a warm connection being forged), in which case they can be observed to subtly change their attitude or comportment, perhaps looking for graceful ways to exit the conversation, or even getting a bit terse if they believe that you are being inattentive, being harsh/judgmental, or refusing to reciprocate their willingness to share and create mutual understanding. Look to their auxiliary function to see how they go about achieving their social goals."
Si,"Xx dominants tend to be comparers who often discuss the details of how things seem different than their expectations, usually in contrast with something similar that they have experienced before or learned secondhand from a trusted source. Because of such comparisons, they are likely to make value judgments about how something compares favorably or poorly to what they expected, sometimes giving the impression that they are too constrained or inflexible in their outlook or unable to see the present with fresh eyes, and some can be sensitive about this and even go so far as to humbly admit that they might not be the most interesting person in the world due to preferring the comforts of familiarity. They like to recount interesting stories or provide fine details or descriptions to back up their comparative analyses. If they know you well, they might point out inconsistencies in your speech or behavior patterns, often using such details to investigate whether something is not right with you. Sometimes Xx can intrude and make them sense that there might exist other possible ways of doing or looking at something, a way that they have not yet learned about or experienced firsthand, in which case they might seek an alternative/fresh opinion from you to add to their database of knowledge (especially if they trust in your authority or expertise) and then feel impressed or entertained if you can successfully change their perspective on something. Even though some might scoff at ideas that seem too “out there” or unexpected, if you give them enough time to process and reflect on it, they might come around more easily than you initially anticipated because they simply needed some time to find just the right place for the new idea in their mental library. Look to the auxiliary function to see what kinds of details they are most attentive to."
Ni,"Xx dominants tend to be unintentional teases in the sense that they only express a very small fraction of what they are thinking. This is because they suffer from a cognitive bias commonly referred to as “the curse of knowledge”. Since they unconsciously gather a lot of information about the abstract future, they have a tendency to assume everyone has access to that same data, in other words, they have difficulty accurately calculating the exact gap of knowledge between themselves and others, failing to realize that it is sometimes necessary to set aside their own subjective understanding to get a more objective view of other people - they are often entirely unaware of how driven they are by their own subjective intuitive interpretations. This means that, in lengthy conversations, they generally prefer to be avid listeners and then spit out the occasional incisive comment, getting straight to the heart of the matter or tunneling towards the most fundamental point/purpose of the discussion because they want the deepest understanding possible in order to grasp what it means for future development. This sometimes leaves the other party wanting to ask about how the idea/insight came up, which can result in a visible struggle to explain the convoluted intuitive process. Some will just avoid explaining or dismiss the details as “insignificant” in the grand scheme of things, or some might deflect your question by asking you a question in return, or some might even get offended and claim that you should “just know” what they know. They tend to be most absorbed when discussing and playing with interesting ideas and theories but only to a point, that is, they like to explore, at great length, ideas that pertain to the subjects they consider to be meaningful or important but usually have less patience for topics that meander far away from that boundary, unless you can successfully prove that the new ideas are somehow connected or relevant to them. They can sometimes ramble in a winding fashion when given free reign to talk about what they are passionate about. They may sometimes come off as overserious, uptight, snobby, condescending, or overconfident (and sometimes they actually are, and sometimes they really aren’t), perhaps unwittingly reserving their relaxed and humorous side for their closest friends. Some can be quite hard to connect with because of seeming very aloof or even preachy due to a severe detachment from the present, a problem that can be greatly compounded by their tendency to dislike or shun small talk (due to misinterpreting it as “pointless”). Sometimes Xx can intrude and make them aware that they are too removed or not expressing themselves clearly enough and must put greater effort into the conversation, in which case they might try to be more clear and present or actively seek out ideas from you, showing more energy if you can surprise them with an interesting new outlook to sink their teeth into. Look to their auxiliary function to see what kinds of ideas or theories they generally enjoy exploring."
Ti,"Xx dominants tend to be information oriented and like to display a good grasp of facts, perhaps even spouting factoids or opinions or pointing out errors at inopportune or unwelcome times. They tend to be direct in their speech, stating what they believe to be the most relevant information and sometimes overlooking or miscalculating how that information will be received by the other party. They like to learn new ideas that can solve personal problems, challenge their capabilities or improve their skills, expand upon their interests or hobbies, or creatively improve their daily living standards, and they are often very eager to exchange such information should you express an interest in doing so. Since they subconsciously take pride in being competently knowledgeable, they have a tendency to try to impress or even one-up others in conversation (because that is what catches their eye in others), which can lead to them inadvertently ignoring whether people are truly enjoying themselves, getting far too engrossed in the informational aspect of the discussion and then forgetting to attend to everyone’s emotional needs. They can start to feel uneasy and perhaps want to remove themselves if conversations become excessively personal or emotional or if the subject matter is too far removed from what that they like or feel competent with (some may even scorn these topics, unwilling to participate in such “mushiness”). Sometimes Xx can intrude and make them aware that the dynamics of the conversation do not feel right (i.e. they suddenly sense that their ideas or behaviors are not being well received), in which case they might try to change the subject, look for ways to escape the conversation, fumble awkwardly for a strategy to engage people better, or even seek affirmation by doubling down on their efforts to impress (and probably fail as their anxiety or feelings of incompetence get too disruptive). Look to their auxiliary function to see how they go about learning and exchanging new information."
Fi,"Xx dominants tend to be focused on the deeply experiential aspects of life such as personal preferences, likes and dislikes, interests and passions, meaningful events or turning points, moral beliefs or values, or how they are feeling about life in general, so their conversations are often populated with these topics. They tend to speak from a heavy “I” perspective, using their own experiences as a jumping off point for understanding others, which can sometimes make it difficult for them to wrap their heads around experiences or ideas that are very different from theirs, and they may even project their experiences onto you in an effort to empathize and understand you better. When listening, they reflexively relate your experience back to their own, always searching for a sense of warmth in a person who can share their preferences and values. When talking about themselves, they can be animated by interesting topics but also display some reserve in terms of not revealing too much private information until enough trust has been established or until there is a clear need to reveal it because private experience is their own and not something to be widely disseminated for no good reason, especially if it could lead to pushback, criticism, or offense. Because they place great value upon the uniqueness of individual experience, relationship bonds can develop slowly as they reveal themselves at a gradual pace that ensures individuality is fully understood and honored with every step. Sometimes Xx can intrude and make them subconsciously desire outside validation of their beliefs and values (because otherwise they cannot refine their values to be more congruent with the outside world and then they get stuck in their own personal biases), in which case they will probably do something to express themselves more vocally or seek your acknowledgement more assertively, wanting you to accept them as they truly are and becoming sensitive to anything you say/do that might diminish, disrespect, or devalue their personal experience - they are often quite respectful of other people’s preferences and boundaries and would like the same treatment in return. They might feel the urge to protest or abruptly correct situations in which they feel violated, misunderstood, or misjudged, and then pull back when they have sufficiently spoken up for themselves or when they realize how jarringly aggressive they were suddenly being. Look to their auxiliary function to see how they like to explore and discuss their ideas and experiences."

Si,"Xx learns knowledge incrementally, in very detailed steps that build concretely and linearly upon previous steps. Xx doms have the advantage of being very careful and methodical in doing things the right way the first time around and thus make fewer mistakes. However, Xx tends to process data rather slowly because of needing time to absorb it into a preexisting knowledge framework."
Ni,"Xx speculates about the significance and importance of information gathered, (subconsciously) connecting disparate ideas together into something meaningful. Xx doms have the advantage of creating new insights from old knowledge. However, Xx tends to get messy/convoluted because of needing to explore several routes before discovering how to best put an idea to good use."
Se,"Xx uses practical application, hands-on engagement, and immediate feedback for learning quickly, using trial by fire to correct errors in real-time. Xx doms have the advantage of reaching intermediate competence faster than most. However, Xx often has difficulty achieving sustained progress and true mastery without seeing constant and tangible results, thus quite easily discouraged by plateaus, obstacles, or setbacks."
Ne,"Xx is easily triggered into entertaining new ideas and possibilities, immediately brainstorming many ways to approach an experience, task, or problem. Xx doms have the advantage of being open-minded to unconventional methods and innovative in creating new trends. However, Xx tends to become scattered/unfocused due to chasing meaningless tangents or getting lost in endless rabbit holes."
Ti,"Xx takes information and works to systematize it in accordance with simple logic, automatically dissecting problems for causal factors and dismissing data that is irrelevant to the solution or desired outcome. Xx doms have the advantage of being very self-confident, precise, and accurate in troubleshooting problems. However, Xx tends to have a one-track-mind that doesn’t know how to account for complexity or complicating factors."
Te,"Xx structures all information along unambiguous rules, labels, and categories that are derived solely from hard empirical data, thereby making judgments quickly and confidently. Xx doms have the advantage of facing facts and efficiently changing their approach to meet a challenge more effectively. However, Xx tends to have great difficulty processing ambiguity, nuance, subtlety, and the unpredictable due to only caring about results, and thereby frequently misses out on important information."
Fi,"Xx needs to feel personal relevance to information, using interest, passion, or desire to motivate learning. Xx doms have the advantage of caring deeply about what they learn and thus derive more satisfaction/fulfillment from using the knowledge successfully. However, Xx tends to waver as interest wavers, often unable to persist in learning when the process becomes difficult or challenging."
Fe,"Xx evaluates information based on feelings and human impact, often relying on collective intelligence to establish personal confidence. Xx doms have the advantage of being able to understand several different perspectives to achieve a broader understanding of the subject. However, Xx tends to have difficulty processing purely technical information and feels insecure about knowledge until it is verified/confirmed by a reliable external source."
Si,"Xx is good for: learning incrementally by always relating new knowledge to previously learned knowledge; learning with the appropriate method by relying on tried-and-true procedures that have proven to be effective through past experience (either your own or others’); forming good study habits because of practicing and routinizing them; reaching greater levels of expertise because of the willingness to practice and painstakingly adjust/correct every detail that is impeding progress"
Si,"Too much Xx (over Xx): difficulty with integrating new ideas that are too far removed from your previous learning; trouble with adapting to new learning environments; difficulty with improvising or learning in unstructured environments where rules are not clearly defined; difficulty with seeing the bigger picture and connecting ideas that don’t have obvious connections; difficulty brainstorming or coming up with new and viable ideas for progress; difficulty finding the best possible method of doing something"
Si,"Therefore, you should develop strategies/procedures to learn more sequentially: break up knowledge or materials into linear steps/modules and then follow them properly and patiently instead of jumping around in an unfocused manner. Practice, practice, practice: learn from your mistakes and correct the details in order to foster gradual long term improvement. Learn to enjoy the process of building confidence through mastering details instead of dismissing details as boring or unnecessary."
Si,"Offset excessive Xx with Xx: You should develop strategies for learning methodically so that you can continue to learn even after the initial excitement has worn off. It is important to approach learning in an organized way if you want to make the best use of your time. When you get interested in an idea or subject, the first step should be to understand the structure of the knowledge. For instance, look at the table of contents or the headers in a book/article so that you are clear about the order in which the information should ideally be learned. Good writers organize material very deliberately in a way that facilitates efficient absorption of knowledge, so heed their system as a first step in learning because they understand the material much better than you do. Skipping around too much when you study will make it hard to connect ideas linearly/sequentially and then you will be more likely to miss important details or shift your attention elsewhere before you have developed a solid understanding of the concept. You can also use the structure of the information to remind yourself that you have not learned enough. You might sometimes feel satisfied if you have understood the gist of the information and then stop learning. However, the gist is never enough because it fools you into thinking that you know something when you have only understood it intellectually and superficially in the moment, meaning that, once you are forced to express and clarify your ideas in detail or apply the ideas in practical settings like an exam or discussion, you will flounder because of having too many holes and gaps in your knowledge - the devil is always in the details. Thus, use the appropriate learning method or structure to break up learning into straightforward steps, creating linear benchmarks or checkpoints to reach in succession, thereby ensuring that you grasp all the necessary details and avoid abandoning things midstream."
Ne,"Offset excessive Xx with Xx: You should take more time to explore new ideas/possibilities even if you cannot see the immediate practical benefits of doing so. Think about whether what you have learned in one subject can be creatively connected to or applied in other fields. Think about the different ways in which an idea or concept can be applied in all manner of real life situations. Think about how an idea can be developed into something better. Think about whether a solution is really as effective as it could be. Think about whether there is a more creative solution to a problem. Think about whether there is more that can be learned. If you cannot seem to expand your thinking, try to come up with more questions as you learn, or discuss ideas with people who help you open up your perspective. When approaching a new idea or subject, think about why someone would study it: have you really understood where the interest lies, have you realized the full importance, potential, or applicability of the knowledge? Learning knowledge for a concrete reason like an exam is important, but true wisdom comes from being able to apply knowledge in different ways. And you will not be able to find other interesting or creative applications for your knowledge if you limit yourself to learning only what is necessary for your immediate goals."
Ne,"Therefore, when you encounter ideas or subjects that you initially judge as “impractical” or “useless” or “crazy”, you should instead try to open up your mind to learn more. If someone else can devote their lives to studying the subject, there must surely be some value in it even though you have not seen it yet yourself. Treat ideas as tangible objects and you will begin to see that, even if they do not have any practical application at the moment, they can potentially be useful in the future with the right development or under the right circumstances, e.g., this is the process of how practical technological advances come out of obscure scientific ideas or theories. In other words, store abstract ideas away just as you would keep concrete tools around, because they might come in handy at some later point."
Ne,"Xx is good for: seeing the potential in ideas/subjects for enhancing personal knowledge/interest, making progress in learning, creating positive change, or solving problems; being very open to new ideas about how to apply knowledge in different settings; developing a very broad knowledge base; being creative in connecting existing ideas/details into new possibilities; enjoying the process of discovering or exploring new possibilities"
Ne,"Too much Xx (over Xx): overlooking/dismissing important rules or details that are critical for success; trouble sticking with a subject long enough to reach high level expertise; too easily distracted by new ideas to develop any of them to their full potential; difficulty prioritizing what to learn and when; difficulty following the best method or procedure for learning; difficulty sequencing ideas carefully to form a coherent structure for the information (messy learning style); difficulty absorbing knowledge properly because of stopping the learning process when you only have the “gist” of something, which leads to trouble remembering important information; difficulty forming good study habits because of undervaluing the necessity of maintaining regular habits and good physical health; difficulty learning in environments that require extended focus and strict adherence to procedures (in which there is not enough time/space to explore ideas)"
Se,"Xx is good for: learning quickly by using hands-on, first-hand, or participatory strategies; observing and replicating skills accurately through imitation; enhancing and reinforcing “muscle” memory of tasks through good practice; making fast and proper corrections through trial and error; improvising and adapting well to changing conditions; fostering enjoyment of facing challenges; learning how to apply concepts in real-life situations; using experimentation or practical applications to refine theory towards greater accuracy"
Se,"Too much Xx (over Xx): easily bored when there are no opportunities for active learning and participation; easily give up in the face of difficult challenges or conditions that require perseverance and sustained effort; difficulty improving skills while working alone through reflection or rote learning; difficulty making good progress if not getting enough tangible feedback on progress; difficulty delaying gratification for achieving long term goals; difficulty reaching mastery once you are proficient enough to achieve immediate goals (like an exam or passing the course); difficulty learning in environments that require extended focus and long periods of physical inactivity"
Se,"Just because you seem to understand a concept intellectually the moment you hear it, doesn’t mean you will remember it, know how to “do” or apply it, so put out greater effort to make use of ideas and concepts in practical or real-life settings. This also makes the learning process more interesting because you may discover all kinds of new details, extensions, extrapolations, or applications you would not have otherwise considered if you only play around with ideas in your head (which is a closed ecosystem). By actively applying knowledge, you adjust your ideas to fit reality rather than trying to force or apply ideas inappropriately."
Se,"Offset excessive Xx with Xx: Develop strategies that help you understand and integrate factual details better. Be more open to accepting detailed feedback about how ideas can be adjusted to be more efficient, effective, practical, or realistic. Value the details: think of the bigger picture not as an end goal but rather as a skeleton that requires facts and details to make up the meat of your knowledge (a skeleton looks very different than a fully formed living and breathing body even though they share the same underlying structure). Consciously link details in an orderly way, e.g., sequentially or logically, or use visual aids to lay it all out. Get an idea of the larger framework by studying the headers or table of contents to see how the material is structured. Understanding the gist or main point alone is never enough because things often fall apart if you haven’t considered the details carefully enough when applying knowledge - this is a necessary step for achieving realistic ideas and effective outcomes. Without enough attention to detail or changes in conditions, even the best of ideas will turn into squandered potential."
Ni,"Xx is good for: seeing the bigger picture in terms of knowing the implications of what you’re learning; connected/unified learning that brings together many details into a meaningful whole; synthesizing or reconciling different/opposing viewpoints; quickly grasping the main point and the underlying meaning of words, ideas, concepts, or theories; creation or extrapolation of new meaning from old knowledge; willingness to patiently unravel and understand complexity; appreciation of the unknown and filling in gaps in knowledge; enjoyment of learning as a means to pursue personal growth."
Ni,"Too much Xx (over Xx): neglecting important facts and details due to unrealistic expectations; difficulty integrating factual details that do not fit one’s subjective beliefs; difficulty visualizing anything but what one already expects to happen; overthinking/convoluted thinking due to not exercising judgment functions; tunnel vision in terms of assigning too much importance to one particular idea or concept; overconfident or stubborn in thinking there is only “one true way” of understanding something (too subjective); unwilling to examine/challenge (unconscious) assumptions that are impeding the learning process; difficulty learning in environments where conditions change too quickly to predict what will happen"
Ni,"Thus, the first thing you should do when learning is to understand the bigger picture in order to see the importance of the knowledge rather than focusing too much on the immediate usefulness of it. Ask yourself why it is important to learn this, aside from its immediate benefits. When you learn something new, think about how that knowledge can be used or applied in a variety of different contexts or settings. Open yourself up to seeing things from different angles in order to foster patience for creative thinking even if there is no immediate payoff or benefit in doing so. It often requires concentration and the willingness to reflect on something for awhile in order to come up with a new idea or ideal solution. Pay more attention to your hunches and develop them into something tangible or practical. Try to connect ideas in new ways to produce better ideas. Discuss ideas with other people who are more knowledgeable than you in order to see alternative viewpoints or read materials that provide a counterpoint view of the subject, thereby gaining a deeper and more well-rounded understanding."
Ni,"Offset excessive Xx with Xx: Find alternative strategies to keep yourself engaged when ideal learning conditions do not exist, e.g.: participate more in class, form study groups where you can discuss ideas with others, choose courses/instructors that include a variety of learning methods, try to teach concepts to others, give a mock presentation of the material, write down your ideas and organize them, and so on. Be creative in making opportunities to engage with the knowledge more interactively rather than waiting for opportunities to drop in your lap or abandoning ship when you get bored. Sometimes, when you have achieved acceptable competence (”good enough”), you may feel that it is okay to stop learning, which means that you will never reach a deeper understanding of the subject. To prevent this, make sure to ask yourself whether you have really understood all there is to know about something - have you looked at this idea/subject from every available perspective? Greater depth of knowledge increases your competence and performance dramatically, allowing you to exceed expectations in ways you probably couldn’t imagine at the beginning, so learn to value depth of understanding rather than seeing it as unnecessary, tedious, or a waste of time. There are always many ways of understanding anything and using only one way might be enough to pass a test, but it is not enough for becoming a master. If you confine yourself to learning knowledge that only has immediate or observable benefits or payoffs, you will be missing out on a lot of opportunities to improve yourself or to further your potential. In other words, learn for the sake of learning itself or personal growth. Take a more reflective approach to learning by pondering questions longer and digging more deeply into topics. Learn from people who know more than you or have a different viewpoint and you will gradually begin to see that having deeper knowledge is useful in itself because it makes your mind more flexible and adaptable by enriching creative connections, granting you greater resourcefulness by turning challenges into opportunities."
Ti,"Xx is good for: dissecting or breaking down ideas to get a better understanding of basic principles; picking apart how things work and understanding how to manipulate the variables of a system to achieve better results; refining knowledge towards greater precision; building up the necessary skills or accumulating the proper knowledge for undertaking a task or adapting to a new situation; understanding cause and effect as accurately as possible; analyzing ideas/systems for flaws and errors; coming up with elegant solutions"
Ti,"Too much Xx (over Xx): overconfident in thinking that your solution or understanding will make sense to everyone; tunnel vision in drilling too far into little details at the expense of the bigger picture; being too reductive in identifying simple causes for complex effects; difficulty putting ideas back together into a coherent system once you’ve picked them apart; not recognizing gaps in your own knowledge because of not getting enough external feedback; not recognizing the poor quality of your ideas because of not properly testing them in the external world; too focused on flaws and problems to appreciate the process of learning or the positive aspects of what you are learning; difficulty learning in environments that are very interactive or require complex teamwork"
Ti,"Thus, it is important to improve your analytical thinking skills. Writing is a very good way to develop your reasoning skills because it forces you to make your ideas tangible and organized, and then it will be easier to evaluate them from a distance, especially if you go the extra step of asking for critical feedback on them. "
Ti,"Offset excessive Xx with Xx: Be more patient when you are dealing with technical or complicated information. Take time to break down ideas carefully and learn in small steps to build up knowledge gradually. Don’t take information at face value, rather, develop the habit of questioning what you are learning - ask the “why” questions. Develop your analytical and critical thinking skills (there are many books on this subject) so that you know how to evaluate ideas for truth/falsity by yourself. This is very important for being able to form your own ideas/opinions and then you will feel more confident when expressing them. Examine how you handle criticism because you should be able to welcome critical analysis of your ideas from others in order to ensure that you have understood something properly. If you have trouble taking criticism, you will saddle yourself with incoherent ideas that lead to problems/errors. Sometimes it might seem like technical information is too dry or boring but it is necessary to learn because, without understanding the basic principles well enough, you cannot discover good ideas or good solutions to the problems that you want to address. For example, if you want to solve a problem like poverty, instead of blindly pouring money every which way, it is necessary to drill down and create “boring” experiments and analyze “dry” statistics/results in order to ensure that the solution is the best one."
Fe,"Xx is good for: broad understanding by considering a wide variety of viewpoints and opinions; learning quickly through sharing and exchanging ideas efficiently; building up a powerful knowledge base quickly through combining good ideas from multiple minds; using feedback to quickly weed out bad ideas; learning subjects that are related to human experience; learning in environments that include teamwork, consensus building, or people skills"
Fe,"Too much Xx (over Xx): too easily swayed by outside opinions; lack of confidence in expressing personal opinions or difficulty forming solid opinions; difficulty learning on your own without getting enough outside feedback; work too much for external rewards (e.g. praise or approval) and neglect intrinsic motivation or personal development; difficulty parsing complex or purely technical concepts; difficulty spotting contradictions/flaws in your own thinking without help; difficulty with subjects that do not relate back to human experience; difficulty learning in environments that are too competitive or too critical (in which there is little respect for people’s emotional well-being)"
Fe,"Offset excessive Xx with Xx: Avoid confusing facts and values, i.e., do not assume that “what is” is equal to “what should be”. While it is important to understand the facts, be careful when trying to extrapolate from those facts into areas that are outside of your expertise. For example, there have been scientists in the past who have tried to apply Darwin’s idea of 'survival of the fittest” to human society, thereby justifying harmful ideas like eugenics. In other words, they used the facts that only apply in one area to justify their value judgments in another area. This confusion of facts and values comes from the faulty assumption that human beings can be fully “objective” in understanding the world. However, when you assume that your knowledge is completely “objective”, you actually become completely blind to your prejudices and implicit biases, unaware of the wider impact that your ideas might have. Therefore, it is important to always leave room for doubt or skepticism because one person cannot know all of the variables or factors of a situation, so always be willing to collect more information to refine your knowledge. This requires using your extraverted functions (Se/Ne/Fe) to gather more outside feedback and criticism of your ideas. Seek out feedback and use it to improve your mental models, especially if you are trying to apply old knowledge in new situations, because new situations often introduce new factors that you have not previously considered. Experiment with ideas by finding ways to test them so that you have proper proof that the ideas are good instead of assuming that they are good just because they make sense in your own mind."
Fe,"Be more willing to look at things from different vantage points in order to broaden your learning process. Understand how different people view/approach the topic, which helps you realize that not everyone sees it the same way as you."
Te,"Xx is good for: understanding the standards that must be met in order to achieve a goal; using the most efficient path to a goal; cutting to the chase; breaking down a goal or the learning process into linear steps; delegating tasks and organizing people to achieve an objective; identifying and solving problems effectively; determination in meeting challenges; enjoyment in removing obstacles successfully"
Te,"Too much Xx (over Xx): categorical thinking that becomes universalized and rejects new information; learning only for superficial external rewards; placing too much emphasis on external benchmarks of success; taking shortcuts that block further learning; tendency to justify the wrong method to achieve the desired result; too focused on results to enjoy the journey; mental laziness in only doing what is absolutely necessary to maintain the appearance of succeeding; difficulty learning in unstructured or chaotic environments"
Te,"Improve your organization skills: 1) organize your thoughts by improving your critical thinking skills, 2) organize your actions by learning how to plan and manage time better, 3) organize your life by setting achievable goals and linear steps towards them, 4) organize your personal growth by tackling each of your flaws/weaknesses one by one. Tackle problems head on by learning what you must to resolve them, such that you build self-confidence gradually through increasing your capabilities."
Te,"Offset excessive Xx with Xx: Strategy, strategy, strategy - you must find effective strategies for handling whatever problems you have. The one question that you should always default to when you hit any obstacle is: “What’s my strategy?” There are going to be times when you don’t feel like working, so what’s your strategy for dealing with that? There are going to be times when you feel overwhelmed by the workload, so what’s your strategy? There are going to be times when you have bad habits that prevent you from achieving success, so what’s your strategy for changing them? There are going to be times when you need to suck it up and keep going in order to achieve a goal, so what’s your strategy for powering through? It’s easy to run, but that means being incompetent forever, because overcoming challenges is precisely the way to build your competence. Find strategies for motivation like: do projects with others, have others remind you of what is important, post reminders to yourself about what you are working for and why, take frequent breaks so you don’t burn out, schedule better so you don’t get overwhelmed, break up tasks into manageable steps, get help or emotional support, remove distractions, and so on. There are so many ways to solve a problem, therefore, try to avoid sinking into hopelessness and, instead, brainstorm and test out different strategies until you find one that works well for you. Don’t repeat bad strategies. Instead of beating yourself up when you fail, take it as a chance to learn from your mistakes and adjust your strategy accordingly so that you come back better than before. If possible, build confidence by applying your knowledge and skills in scenarios where you can be helpful to others because this will foster a sense of purpose that adds to your motivation to learn. "
Fi,"Xx is good for: fostering personal interest, passion, or motivation in learning; expressing yourself and your values through your work; taking healthy pride in what you produce; producing work that has a positive impact on the world in terms of benefiting people’s well-being or helping them to be more open to healthy self-expression; being highly devoted to what you love to do"
Fi,"Too much Xx (over Xx): difficulty learning things that you are uninterested in or dislike; fluctuating levels of motivation that make it difficult to persist towards long term goals; getting easily bogged down as you reach higher levels of learning that require more effort or practice; rationalizing poor results away by claiming that you don’t care or that “the system” is stacked against you; tendency to inflate problems because of excessive worry/anxiety; avoiding difficult problems or complex issues because of low self-esteem; feeling unqualified to express a coherent opinion; difficulty with logical analysis; difficulty understanding why certain rules and standards must be followed (thinking they don’t apply to you); difficulty with the idea of “success” and what it takes to reach it (i.e. unwilling to sacrifice or delay gratification for long term goals); difficulty learning in environments that do not allow enough space and acceptance for personal expression and exploration"
Fi,"Offset excessive Xx with Xx: When you work too much for external gains/rewards, you start to lose sight of why you are learning in the first place. Where is your personal passion? Where is your enjoyment of the learning process? Where is your pride in achieving goals the right way through hard work (instead of taking shortcuts)? These things are important for having the right direction in life, otherwise, everything you do becomes unfeeling and perfunctory, lifeless and empty, which may lead you to do destructive things out of boredom. Be less focused on results and how learning enriches your personal growth. When you focus entirely on results, you will end up ignoring all kinds of important information that could be useful to learn even though it will not be applicable in this one particular instance. For example, when studying for an exam, you might commit yourself to learning only the points that will be tested and ignore everything else. When you learn in this manner, you never achieve true mastery because you are eliminating too much information. While your learning produces good results in the short term, over the long term, you will be putting yourself at a disadvantage because of not accumulating knowledge with as much depth or detail as other people who have a genuine interest in learning for the sake of learning. At some point, it is likely that the limited knowledge you possess will be stretched too thin and too far and you will start to feel as though you are falling behind or in over your head, producing discomfort and turmoil that feels discouraging and defeating. This kind of results-oriented and excessively streamlined learning can be detrimental in your personal life as well because it causes you to jump to conclusions too quickly and make mistakes. Therefore, try to keep yourself open to hearing new information when tackling a problem rather than making hasty assumptions that lead to poor outcomes. Also, when you want to apply old knowledge to new situations, take more time to make careful and detailed comparisons, e.g., are you sure that this situation is exactly the same as the previous one, are there any new situational factors that need to be taken into account? In this way, your knowledge will be more detailed and nuanced, thereby increasing mental flexibility and adaptability to change."
Fi,"When you are learning, do not merely learn for the sake of some empty goal that society or the system tells you is important, that is, you should also think about whether the learning has some personal importance or significance to you. Think about how to harness personal passion and self-expression to support learning because it will help you to set appropriate goals and keep you motivated over time so that you do not push yourself too hard or feel like a machine who just goes through the motions. Without personal passion and self-expression, learning can become a painful and boring slog that you push yourself through on a daily basis rather than a process that brings you to life. Apply your knowledge in interesting ways, e.g., do creative activities to reinvigorate your interest in subjects that have become too humdrum or routine, use pet projects as a productive distraction when work becomes too stressful or boring, use your knowledge to benefit others. This allows you to learn for your own personal enrichment."
Si,"The need for roots. Everyone needs to feel rooted in something in order to feel a sense of stability, continuity, and substance. To know the self, you must have a solid foundation, something that informs you of what you are and where you have been and how you should proceed, not grasping for too much too soon. This encourages you to be faithful, disciplined, devoted, moderate, and responsible for the future."
Ni,"The need for meaning. Everyone needs to understand what really makes actions worthwhile in order to feel a sense of purpose and direction. To know the self, you must see yourself realistically and be able to visualize and realize a better version of yourself, your life, and your rightful place in the world. This encourages you to be reflective, aspirational, humble in the face of the unknown, patient to learn and explore, and committed to ultimate truth."
Ti,"The need for coherence. Everyone needs accurate knowledge in order to feel capable and confident in the face of problems and challenges. To know the self, you must be willing to understand your own motivations and correct your shortcomings and weaknesses so as to produce the best outcomes when acting. This encourages you to carefully analyze, deconstruct, reconstruct, and adapt your ideas to the facts of the world."
Fi,"The need for integrity. Everyone needs to have the freedom for authentic self-expression, to feel as though the self is significant and honored. To know the self, you must take time to discover the most authentic aspects of yourself and subsequently realize the need for every individual to possess such a freedom. This encourages you to be sensitive to the needs of self and others, and to use that knowledge to promote moral action whenever possible."
Se,"The need for engagement. Everyone needs to feel at one with their surroundings in order to feel like an important and integral part of the things that happen in the world, to feel as though one is truly living life to the fullest. To connect well with the world, you must interact with it as it comes at you, spreading good actions in order to leave a positive footprint with each step, not just watching life pass you by. This encourages you to be observant, grateful, adaptable, proactive, and resourceful."
Ne,"The need for progress. Everyone needs to feel hopeful about the future, to feel as though change and improvement are possible with the right development. To connect well with the world, you must nurture inspiration, to see the potential in things and try to make it tangible, not just unquestioningly accepting bad circumstances. This encourages you to be observant, creative, innovative, and making positive change wherever you go."
Te,"The need for competence. Everyone needs to feel as though their actions make a difference in the world, to feel confident in effecting change. To connect well with the world, you must respect the facts of how it operates and align yourself with those facts whenever possible to produce the best results, not just complaining or wishing things were different. This encourages you to be skilled, assertive, decisive, persistent, and responsible."
Fe,"The need for relationship. Everyone needs to feel understood, appreciated, accepted, and loved by others, to have a good social support system. To connect well with the world, you must understand how you impact people and how they impact you and how to foster a sense of unity and cooperation among people (in society), not just living for yourself. This encourages you to be sensitive, kind, compassionate, inclusive, forgiving, and generous."
Te,"to use the external facts and evidence to draw conclusions and act on them to achieve a tangible result. It wants to create a system applicable to any situation, which anyone can use, regardless of their background or level of intelligence. It likes to organize the external world through delegation, sequential learning or teaching, and “order” in the process (spreadsheets, to-do-lists, and the organizing of business or personal files)."
Ti,"to build an internal framework of logic, which is consistent and makes sense to themselves. It wants to take things apart (either metaphorically or literally) to understand all the components that make something work, so they can know the system or object from the inside out, and thus find ways to “hack” it. It takes a long time to build this understanding, but then moves forward with confidence, applying the framework to each new piece of information to see if it fits. It’s main focus is internal organization (organizing things within the mind, rather than in the external world)."
Fe,"to judge situations based on their impact on the social group and individuals involved, to motivate other people to work together to accomplish similar goals, finding ways to bring people together through shared values. Objective ethics, does not favor anyone as higher than anyone else. Tends to feel what others feel, does not need a similar experience to have empathy. General discomfort when others display inappropriate emotions in the wrong context, since the goal is to reach a similar emotional state. Uses “mirroring” of other people to bond with them."
Fi,"to judge situations based on a personal system of ethics (formed of how Xx wants to be treated or its beliefs), to pursue self-understanding, and not violate an internal standard of behavior. Tends to judge based on “what I would do.” Subjective ethics, prioritizes a single point of view. Relates to others through self-referencing, unable to understand or empathize without a personal experience or by putting themselves in someone else’s shoes. Never feels what other people feel, strongly resistant to being told what to feel in a social context; their emotions are often out of sync with the situation."
Se,"to interact with opportunities and have experiences in the real world, to act confidently within the sensory world by being able to see how this decision can make something else happen quickly. Focus lies on absorbing situations and experiences, immersing self in them, and living fully in the moment. Learns through being hands on and “doing.”"
Si,"to interact with the sensory world and take away from it individual impressions and experiences, to help build an internal catalogue of experiences from which you can draw “similarities” when approaching unknown situations, which helps you know how to navigate situations with confidence. Learns through observation, seeing how others succeed, and following their process. Good with repeated sequential learning until it becomes an automatic process of expertise."
Ne,"to instantly connect to, explore, and consider all new ideas as equal and talk about them with confidence, seeing their potential and longing to implement them quickly, also seeing both sides of an issue and how this idea connects to a different train of thought. This all happens very quickly. It can abandon ideas once they prove ineffectual for newer and better ideas, so it tends to wing situations with confidence. Often changes perspectives, has no firm view of the future since it is always changing."
Ni,"to perceive the futuristic implications of new ideas, behaviors, and attitudes, to visualize things completely and carefully before they start to implement them in the real world, and to internally consider many different perspectives before reaching a single perception. Tests ideas before they embrace or reject them. Capable of asserting distant implications with confidence, can find it difficult to change ideas or set another course when faced with difficulties, since they pursue a specific vision."
Se,"is busy noticing all the details of the park and the people in it. Sights. Sounds. Colors. Oh, cool. That ride flips upside down! I’m going to try that. Do you smell those hotdogs? Aren’t they great? I think we ought to go bungee jumping… it’s only $50 for a group of $12! Which way is the Tower of Terror? I’m going to ride down it and watch all you sissies wet your pants when it drops 50 feet in 12 seconds!"
Ne,"sees the possibilities of the park. Look at those two people. You can tell they’re not “together” anymore, but just hanging out for the kid’s sake. See their body language? How many rides are in this park? Do you think anyone ever died here? I think they should put a new ride in this space. Call it the Haunted House of Horrors, and have Dead Presidents in it. You know, they could put up an entire haunted XXXXCXXXXON of the park. That would be awesome. Who do I call to pitch that idea? Stay away from the guy in the red hat. He gives me vibes. Ooh, you know, I could write a story about a murder in a theme park! He could die because the Tilt a Whirl malfunctioned. No, no, because the Tower of Terror ride didn’t stop, it crashed the elevator to the bottom floor! His sister did it. No, his uncle! No, the theme park guy, because he’s freakin’ insane."
Te,"is busy organizing others and coming up with “battle plans.” Which direction do we go first? Give me the park map. Okay, where do we want to be by noon? When and where do we meet for lunch? Who is in charge of watching the kid? Which rides do what? When is the bus leaving? What do we have time for? How long are the lines? Okay, everyone who wants to go on these twelve rides, line up to the left! Everyone else to the right! We meet back here at 7pm! No stragglers! Does everyone have their phone on? Good!"
Fe,"makes sure everyone feels involved and has their needs met. Does everyone have a buddy? Nobody should be alone! Let’s go to the bathroom first, okay? How do we feel about hamburgers for lunch? Is that okay? Let’s meet over there, shall we? Does everyone know the plan, so no one is left behind? Let’s take a vote on which direction to go first! Xx will go on a ride it doesn’t like so a friend doesn’t have to do it alone."
Si,"relates everything around them to past experience. Last time I was here, I threw up on that ride; I’m not going on it again. Oh, hey, that’s the bench I sat on when so-and-so kissed me! Oh, good, the line is shorter this year. Why does this slushie taste different? I think they put less cherry cola in it than before! I feel ripped off. OR… I’ve never been to a theme park before, but that Ferris wheel reminds me of that scene in The Notebook, when Noah won’t take no for an answer, until Allie agrees to go on a date with him…"
Ni,"knows what will happen before it happens. I’m going to take a step back, because that kid is going to spill his slushie all over – yup, there it goes. I know which ride I want to go on. I’ve thought about it all week. I’m going to have an awesome time on that ride. I’m going there first. Wait, there are other rides? I didn’t even notice! I was busy fixating on getting to the head of the line! Ha, Marsha better not go on that thing, she’ll hurl—yep, there she goes."
Ti,"is busy analyzing how the rides work and what makes the most sense. If I go this way, the path winds around past what I want to see, and by the time we’re to meet up, I’ll have been all the way around the park. I won’t have to walk back, or rush from one side of the park to the other. Wait, why are they all walking in the opposite direction? Don’t they know this is the logical way to do it? If you go that way, you’ll engage in needless walking and won’t be able to get through the line in front of the House of Mirrors."
Fi,"decides which direction to go based on what is important to them. I’m going on this ride. No, it’s okay, I can go by myself. I don’t need you to come along unless you want to. I’m serious. I’m not afraid to do it alone. I’m not feeling the burgers, either. You all go ahead. I’m going to dash over to that taco stand. Nope, not going on that ride. You can beg all you want, I won’t do it. I’m scared of heights. Not a chance, bud. Drop it."
Te,"Here is the plan, and the steps needed to accomplish it. I can learn anything complicated. This is your responsibility, and I expect a status report. I measure success by objective means (best-seller lists, stock reports, etc). I have a second plan if the first one fails. Anything can be organized for greater results. This isn’t working right; let me fix it. Here is how you can accomplish your goals. Controlling one’s emotions is important. It takes an hour and ten minutes to get there, with 30 minutes allotment for a traffic jam. We can comfortably do this in two weeks, yes. These are the facts, and if something doesn’t measure the facts, I intend to challenge it."
Te,"This isn’t working right, so let’s talk about how to fix it, and I’ll correct it. I know how long this task will take; I am currently on step four and will be finished in another hour, if you want to come get it. I am following the plan, from Point A to Point B. These are the steps you need to take to accomplish your goals. I am totally comfortable with word counts, hour limits, and deadlines, and have no problem meeting them. I can organize my time to accomplish everything I want to accomplish in a day. Here’s your shopping list. Give me the information and come back in an hour; I will categorize it into an easy to follow format so that everyone knows where we are in the project and what is expected of them. I have no problem controlling my impulses and putting aside my emotions to get things done."
Fe,"I am warm and enjoy taking care of people. I consider how decisions will impact everyone involved. Is there anything I can get you, to make you feel more comfortable? I can’t be with people who don’t treat others with respect. I want to acknowledge not only what each of you has done in the group as individuals, but also talk about what we can do, or have done, together! You did an awesome job with that; you are so talented. I don’t approve of what you are doing, because it’s inappropriate and will have a bad impact on others, but I am willing to talk it through and will accept your apology, without any bad feelings. I feel so at ease offering affirmation, and am deeply hurt when others don’t do the same. I want everyone to be happy, but am not afraid to say what I feel if I need to."
Fe,"I know what is important to you, and can support you in it, provided it doesn’t hurt others. I’m not always comfortable taking sides. Can we talk about this and reach a compromise that keeps everyone happy? I don’t want to upset people, and I can easily fit into a group and make everyone feel wanted and involved. Your emotions can influence mine, so I am careful not to let too many people in. I want to take care of you, and protect you. You are so talented. I hope you know that, and how much I like you. I’m happy to serve, but feel better when I get how I feel off my chest and out into the open."
Ne,"So, what you are REALLY saying, even though you’re disguising it behind bullshit, is this. Do you want to know what writing desks and ravens have in common? Are you sure that this is the right decision? Because I have five other possible interpretations, and it would be a shame not to consider them all. I simply know how this works, and what you are really up to. Let’s talk about ideas! I want to tell you mine and hear yours! I know this idea doesn’t seem related to our discussion, but I think it ties in. I can sum up our concept in a metaphor. I can think of five different things at once! I can pick up your facial expressions and accent without even thinking about it. Let me tell you a story…"
Ne,"Your life has so much potential! I can see many different possibilities for your future! Let me share them with you! There is more than one way to look at this situation. It would be a shame not to talk about them all. That’s a great idea, but what about this? Or this? Or that? Let’s discuss and consider them all. I have an analogy that fits this situation, but you’ll have to hang in there to the end, because at first it will sound random. I promise, it isn’t! Let me paint the big picture for you! Let’s try this, it’s new and it’s crazy but it might work! Yes, I thought you might make that decision / that this would happen. Excuse me, I need to write a story…"
Se,"Experiences are the stuff of life. I want to go snowboarding! Skydiving! Drive a racecar! Give me an adrenaline rush, and I’m fabulous. Okay, what’s up? I saw your eye twitch. That means you’re upset, but about what? Oh, I can leap in there and do this, no problem! See? It’s easy! You need a part time lion tamer? I’m sure I can learn it in no time. Okay, so here are the sixteen awesome things we can do in this theme park. Which one first? Look, you do that, I can hold this, and keep track of the kids, and check my Blackberry, and call Gary back all at the same time. You know, someone could make a lot of money if they—oh, what the heck, I’ll just do it. While you were standing there gaping, I saved the kid from the bus. I want to try that out; I think my body can take it, and it’ll be fun to find out. I’m going to say this, and see what people do…"
Se,"I could be doing one of six things right now, and I’m bored just standing here, so let’s go out and do something! I want to go bike riding again this weekend; there’s this gorgeous place in the mountains that you have to see to believe, but it’s a six mile ride so pack your gear. Uh oh, she’s mad. I saw her facial expression change for a second, and that’s never a good sign. I want to try out lots of things, and test my body to see what it can do. I can learn to do this quickly, and then I want to help you learn it. Come with me! Don’t just stand there, we can do this! Right now, I’m chilling in the backyard with a glass of tea and watching the light move through the trees, but later I want to go rock climbing. I can’t wait! It’s going to be awesome! I can trust what I have experienced first-hand."
Ti,"I don’t need to use my emotions to fix this problem, thanks. I know how this machine works. Let me take it apart and put it back together for you. That doesn’t seem logical. The facts of the situation are unimportant; we can solve this, though it might seem impossible. There is a way around every problem. I can give you a two word answer to your question, and those two words will solve everything. The fewer words used, the better. Most explanations are too long-winded and technical, and could easily be simplified. Let me hear the idea or new data; I’m going to analyze and criticize it, and if it doesn’t work, I’m going to throw it out. Come on, you know my impartiality is sexy. Have you ever seen me overreact to anything? No!"
Ti,"Hmm, give me a second… okay, I know what to do. I know how this works and how to fix it. I just analyzed it from six different angles in my head and feel comfortable with diving right in. I can take this situation or problem apart and reassemble it. That sounds illogical, so I’m going to ignore it. If I have time, I’ll argue with it. Look, cut the crap and get to the point. THXXXX is the problem and THXXXX is how we fix it. Did you enjoy my three word answer? It really annoys me when people take too long to explain something, because it’s easy for me to sum it up in a few words. No, I understand the system, I have it, let’s start in on it and get things done! Hop to it! Chop chop!"
Fi,"I know that this is good, and that is bad. I know that you’re not who you say you are. I don’t need to focus on that particular idea, because it is less important than this other idea or belief. I want to focus on what is important, and I can see the measure of importance of everything in my life: people, causes, thoughts, actions, and feelings. Does this belief conflict with mine? Do I think this action is wrong? If so, I won’t do it. I know what I believe and what is worth believing in. Please, let me have some time to mull over this life-altering decision. I don’t want to make the wrong choice. I feel strong and confident in who I am, and what I believe. I have total faith in you. I know what you need, and will stand up for you when you need me to. I am good at protecting others and showing patience in mediating between them."
Fi,"I am happiest when staying true to what I believe and what I want for my life. I know what I want, what beliefs and ideals motivate me, and how I feel about something. This is good, and that is bad. I know you’re only pretending, because I can see right through you. How does this new belief measure up against my life, my goals, and my core values? I believe no one should enforce morality; it should be a conscious choice we make. I care very much about you. I am loyal to you. I have great enthusiasm and many feelings toward you, but I show it through actions rather than words. You don’t have to say anything for me to be able to connect to and understand your meaning. I am okay with silent affection."
Ni,"No, I haven’t learned this before. I just know how to do it, that’s all. Let me guess what that means… am I right? Yes! I knew it! You can’t ask me to stop thinking about the future; I think about it all the time! That person is going to do that, and this will happen as a result. I am not wrong. You wait and see. (Told you!) I don’t like this, it didn’t happen the way I anticipated it would! No, I don’t want to change my plan at the last minute! How can I fix this? Where did I go wrong? I have a creative way to explain this process to you! Interpreting symbolism comes easily to me. Visualizing my goals, and my future, makes me happy and energizes me! I can see where I want to be, and where I am, and come up with each step necessary to reach my dreams.  "
Ni,"I feel very strongly that this is about to happen, and I intend to use my foreknowledge to do something about it. No, I am not surprised this happened. I knew it would. I am not going to support that company, because they will go under in six months. This person is not worth my time, because they are dishonest and I know they will betray me. Last night, I didn’t know what to do… but now, suddenly, the answer is staring me in the face! I know what to do to accomplish everything! You can’t fool me, because I can see your true self. People tell me that my advice is profound and insightful. I sometimes hide what I know, when I know it, because it freaks people out."
Si,"I know how this works, how it was last week, and how I want it to be in the future. If knitting in that way helped the other person to create that scarf, I feel sure that I can do the same thing by learning the same stitch. I feel happiest when I hold tight to the things that are truly important and lasting in life, such as family, friends, and often, my faith. I find that interesting, but it doesn’t match my memories of what happened. Can you give me more details, so I can decide whether or not to accept it? I know if something or someone is different from how they used to be, and can tell you exactly what has altered. I highly value my past experiences, and find it hard to forget or move past things. I really love participating in local events, family traditions, and cultural things, because it makes me feel like I am part of a living past. I enjoy routine and like things to be predictable."
Si,"The last time I tackled this project, using this technique worked, so I feel confident in my ability to succeed using the same technique. This restaurant is laid out different than it was the last time I was here; those tables were on the patio, and they had red curtains, not green. I’m happy to provide you with the details of why I am making this decision. I recognize this street, so I know where to turn! This holiday is meaningful to me, because it allows me to connect to my family or my culture. I’m disappointed if we can’t celebrate it together every year. If we’re going to do this project, let’s do research to see how others have done it before we start. I like to reflect on my own past experiences when making decisions in the present, and believe I can learn from others’ mistakes."
